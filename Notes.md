* (HW) Read chapter 4

## Simple neural circuit - Knee jerk reflex
![Knee Jerk Reflex](/Images/Patellar_tendon_reflex_arc.png)
  * **Patellar Stretch Reflex** - Maintains specific tension and length of quadriceps muscle
      * Tapping below the knee stretches the muscle, contracts to regain original length, foot swings
      * In muscle, stretch is detected by sensory neuron
          * Neuron exists in ganglion, extends a process out to the muscle to sense
      * **Ganglion** - structure containing a number of nerve cell bodies, physical expansion of spinal chord, connects processes out to muscles.
      * **Dorsal root ganglion** - contains the cell bodies of sensory neurons that bring information from the periphery to the spinal cord. Used in stretch reflex
      * **Ganglion/nucleous** - A collection of nerve cell bodies
      * **Process** - (neurite) extends from ganglion to muscle (term used instead of axon/dendrite)
      * CNS - Spinal chord
          * White matter and gray matter (cross section image)
      * **Sensory Neuron** - Detects signals from environment, sends a process to the CNS into the inner gray matter
          * Then interacts with a second neuron at synapse, *motor neuron*
      * **Pre-Synaptic** - Sensory neuron endings, releases neurotransmitters
      * **Post-Synaptic** - Motor neuron, receives neurotransmitters
      * **Motor neuron** - exists in gray matter of spinal chord, sends signals to muscle via process from CNS
      * **Synaptic cleft** - gap, interacts with receptors on post-synaptic cell
      * Motor neuron's response travels out of the CNS to muscle via a process, here it becomes a pre-synaptic contact with the now post-synaptic muscle.
      * Signal leads to contraction
      * Motor neuron then extends a process back to the muscle
      * **Nerre** - Collection of processes, bundle of sensory and motor fibers
      * **Afferent** - incoming signal to CNS - *dorsal root*
      * **Efferent** - outgoing signal from CNS - *ventral root*
      * **Sensory neuron** - synapses with motor neuron are on the motor neuron's *dendrites*
      * **Motor neuron** - extends an *axon* out to the muscle
      * Neuron has *resting potential* - electrical difference between interior and outside. When electrical potential changes,this signal can be sent through the neuron and to the next neuron in line
      * ACH -  neurotransmitter in the preganglionic sympathetic and parasympathetic neurons

## The Neuron
![alt text](Images/shapes.png)
  * What differs neurons from other cells - Shapes
  * **Shapes of neurons** - reflect who they're connected to (long processes for motor neurons can be 3ft long), where they receive inputs and where they send them
  * **Anaxonal neuron** - Difficult to distinguish between inputs and outputs, no obvious axon
  * **Monopolar** - (unipolar) only one process extends from body
  * **Bipolar** - Branch goes up one way and down another
  * **Multipolar neuron** - classic neuron, cell body with dendrites on body and single axon
  * **Interneurons** - process signals between sensory and motor neurons

### 8-25
  * (HW) will be posted today, due next week wen. Make two copies
  * **Neuroglia cells** - 2-3 times as many than neurons. 5 kinds
    * **Astrogilia** - look like stars, common. Provide physical support and nutrients for neurons. Regulate k+ conc outside nervous system. Remove excess neurotransmitters from extracellular space.
    * **Radialgilia** - Around throughout life of org, important in development. Provide scaffold for migration of neurons.
    * **Microgilia** - immune response. made in bone marrow, highly mobile. clean up cellular debris, see a lot near infections or neurodegenerative diseases (Parkison's, Huntington's, Alzheimer's). Excessive activity during development may remove too many synapses leading to issues like possibly autism??
    * **Oligodenetroglia** - found in CNS (brain, spinal cord) only, generate _myelin_ (flattened cell membrane w/o plasma) from glial cell. Electrical insulator, allows action potentials to move quicker and more reliably. Each _oligodentrocyte_ myelinates several axons.
      * **Nodes of Ranvier** - nodes where AP are generated, gaps in myelin.
    * **Schwann cells** - glial cells outside the CNS, in the PNS. Provide myelin. Myelantes only _one_ axon. Takes own cell body and wraps around, squeezing out most cytoplasm.
    * Difference between _Schwann cells_ and _Oligodentrocyte_:
      * Schwann cells help regenerate nerve damage
      * Oligodentrocytes actually block axon regrowth. Complex issue.
        * Oligodentrocytes block axon regrowth because it prevents mistakes that could be made during regrowth.
    * Similarities between gilia and neurons:
      * Electrical potentials across membranes exist in both
      * Change in response to signals - electrical and neurotransmitters
      * Glial cells are electrically connected to each other and can be connected ot neurons as well
    * Differences between gilia and neuons:
      * glial cells electrical potential changes are much smaller
      * glial cells do not have AP
      * glial cells have smaller cell bodies and are smaller

## Organization of Neural structure
  * Even single cell organisms have some type of nervous systems.
  * **Nerve net** - Networks of interconnected neurons, can have activity that spreads throughout the net. Found in Hydras.
    * Humans have similar arrangements of nerve cells in gut (peristalsis)
  * Most invertebrate animals have a brain and nerve cords, large ganglic along the nerve cord
  * Mammals and other vertebrates also have brain and nerve cord. also have ganglic
  * But invertebrate nerve cords run along the belly side, vertebrate along the _back_ and system is made from a tube and remains tube-like
  * Basic Organization
    * CNS - Brain + spinal cord
    * PNS - Nerves that run to and from organs and muscles, includes nerves and ganglia
    * **Enteric Nervous System** - network of neurons and ganglia on the gut
  * Brains integrate information from a collection of sensors at the front end of the animal
