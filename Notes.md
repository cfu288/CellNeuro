## Neuromodulation
* **Neuromodulation** - Molecules that act on nerves to enhance or inhibit nerves
  * Related in presynaptic cell, cross cleft, bind to receptors on post syn cells but not linked to ion channels
  * Activates 2nd messenger that leads to a change in ion channel like channel opening or closing, or easier or harder to open v-gated channel
* Neuromodulation is slower to activate than neurotransmitter activity. It can also last longer.
* **Neuromodular** - indirect transmitter, lignad binds to metabotropic receptor, using g protein activates ion channel to open in
* Direct transmitter - ligand binds to channel to open it
* **G-proteins** - modulator binds to a receptor = _metabotropic receptor_. Bound receptor becomes activated and activates a G-Protein. Can lead to complex biochemical cascades
* **Metabotrophic receptors structurally** - have 7 transmembrane spanning regions. Have carboxy tail inside, amino terminus outside, binding site outside, bonding site for g-protein inside, phosphorylation sites which when phosphorylated, desensitize the membrane. Some are on carboxyl tail
1. transmitter/modulator binds at its receptor (specific)
2. on the inside, the receptor was bound to a G protein, when the neurotransmitter binds to the receptor, the f protein is activated.
3. G has 3 subinits, a,b,gamma, and bind GDP. sheds GDP, binds to GTP instead. At the same time, the g protein splits and the a subunit seperates from the b and gamma. Active.
4. Subunits, a and bg subunits go on to do things
5. a subunit is a GTPase, GTP -> GDP
6. a-GDP reassembles with bg and reforms the g protein. Also the receptor itself can desensitize and not bind anymore
* **Activated subunits can do many things**
* Muscarinic ACh receptor in the heart is metabotropic
* here the activated g proteins bg subunit binds directly to a K+ channel and conformationally opens channel, brings down membrane potential to slow down heartrate
* Experiment: apply ACh to the outside of a heart muscle membrane - in patch clamp lost of outward current. then find that using an inside out patch clamp apply activated bg subunit _only_ to inside of membrane
* see the same effect as applyinf ACH to outside
* Other metabotrophic systems are more complex
* the activated G protein subunits may activate second messenger biochemical cascades
* 2nd messengers include cAMP, cGMP, NO, Ca++, lipids like DAG, IP3
* may activate adenyl cyclase which makes cAMP and the cAMP can activate things
* for example: Activated Gprotein subunits may activate adente maylyl cyclase which then produces cAMP
* cAMP will activate a protein kinase, protein kinase puts a phosphate on to a protein (phosphorylates the protein) the phosphorylate dprotein could be an ion channel
* To terminate the activity:  
* the phosphate may be removed from the channel by a protein phosphatase
* cAMP can be broken down by _phosphosterase_
* if cAMP is high enough and long enough, can get changes in gene expression (Make more ion channels? or receptors for that molecule)
* Another 2nd messenger system
* in this example the end result is a Ca++ channel is phosphorylated and closed
1. Modulator binds to a receptor on membrane
2. Activated receptor activates a G-Protein
3. Activated G-Protein binds to GTP, splits into alpha-GTP and bg subunits.
Inside the cell membrane is an enzyme, Phospholipase C. Both subunits of G-Protein bind here.

* Variations on this pathway
* PIP2 can open/close channels
* intracellular Ca++ can lead to channels opening/closing or other things
* Why such an complex system?
* amplifies signal
* effect can last a while (seconds or hours)
* if active long enough, can make permanent changes through gene activation
* an activated receptor at one location can effect changes throughout the neuron. Single neuromodulator can create an exponential amount of target proteins
* Final step is to get the modulator off the receptor to inactivate the cascade
* For neuro-transmitter or modulators, enzymes include:
* for ACh => acetylcholine esterase AchE
* for monoamines like Seratonin, Doplamine => monoamine oxidase MAO
* Diffusion away from the postsynaptic cell also negative effect
* Re-uptake mechanisms:
  * presynaptic cell membrane take up transmitter or modulator and returns it to the presynaptic terminal for reuse

## Neurotransmitter release from pre-synaptic terminal
* Chemical synapses have a synaptic delay. (.5 msec)
* temperature sensitive, warmer is faster
* indicates delay involves more than time for diffusion (Diffusion estimated to take.5 msec)
* must take soe time to release the neurotransmitter
* Katz and Miledi 1960's - treat neuromuscular junction with small doses of TTX; find that postsynaptic potentials hae a minimum amplitude. PSPs are multiples of that minimum amplitude
* **minature endplate potential** - Minimum amplitude, aka mini quantal units. Equal to the release of one packet of neurotransmitters (1 vesicle).
* Continuing applying TTX to block all Na channels, then electrically(artificially using electrodes) stimulate presynaptic cell, still see PSPs in muscle.
* Can use TTX and TEA, still get transmitter release when electrically stimulate
* So : Na+ or K+ not needed, although depolarization is needed
* But: if Ca++ is removed from extracellular bath, no transmitter is released.
* Normally, a.p. in presynaptic cell reaches the terminal. The depolarization causes
* voltage gated Ca++ channels to open
* Ca++ enters to the point that [Ca++]in terminal can increase 200x
* Ca++ sensitive dyes in presynaptic terminals show this increase can be used to map stuff out active synapses
* Nitrophen makes 'caged Ca+' it binds it in the terminal - it will release the Ca++ when exposed to UV light
  * presynaptic cell injected w/ nitrophan
  * record postsynaptic cell
  * treat presynaptic cell q/ UV light no depolarization needed
  * Postsynaptic cell shows an epp
  * Therefore,  inc Ca++ can lead to nt release
* Can get epp to minimum size by lowering [Ca++]out (one pack of nt released)
* How much nt is in a single packet?
  * Calculated 7000 in single quantum, need about 2600 to open 1300 channel which is what is seen in a mini
  * rest of ACh must get broken down by AChE or diffuses away
  * For a 'typical' epsp at frog nm junction, there are about 200 quanta released - so a typical epsp opens 2600 channels at one synapse for frog nm junction
  1. presynaptic terminal depolarizes
  2. v-Ca++ channels open
  3. ... Stuff ... covered below
  4. NT is released
  * In presynaptic terminal, there are 2 populations of vesicles
    * Releasable pool - ready to fuse to terminal membtane to release nt into cleft
    * Storage pool - bound to cytoskeleton by _synapsin_
    * When terminal depolarizes, Ca++influx activates a protein kinase which phosphorylates synapsin causing it to undergo conformation change releasing the vesicles it holds to the cytoskeleton
  * to get vesicles to release contents, proteins on vesicle membrane v-SNARES bind to proteins on the terminal membrane T-SNARES and a fusion pore is created and contents are released (DOCKING)
    * after release, vesicle must be recycled
  * On the vesicle (proteins):
    * **Synaptotagmin** - Ca++ dependent step. Binds 5 Ca++ ions, senses Ca++ levels and promotes vesicle docking. it inhibits some molecular clamp on the SNARE complex (t-snares + v-snares) allowing it to form - or allowing T-SNARES to interact with v-SNARES
    * **Synaptobrerin(VAMP)**
  * on the terminal:
    * Syntaxin
    * Snap-25
    * Associated with syntaxin is Munc-18 -  an essential protein that catalyzes the binding of the SNARE complex, precise function is not known.
  * Once the vesicle is bound to the terminal using the SNARE complex, Fusion pore forms- passage between inside of vesicle and outside of terminal so nt can be released
  * don't know how it's made
  * after dumping contents must get off the terminal membrane so another can bind
  * 2 proteins used to dissassemble the SNARE compelex are
    * NSF
    * SNAP
  * Tetanus toxin - cleaves synoptobrevin
  * Botulnum toxins - one type cleaves syntaxin and SNAP-25
  * Black widow spider venom -  active ingredient makes a pore in presynaptic terminal so there is a massive Ca++ influx and massive dumping of NT. Entire vesicles
  * Final step is recycling the vesicle - there is a rapid endocytosis of membtane around empty vesicle making an endosome.
  * new vesicles are made from the endosome, clatherin is a protein that coats new vesicles. Clatherin is then removed so vesicle can be refilled.
  * Refilling - nt works with a specific transporter that is powered by a proton pump -> uses ATP to fill vesicle with H+, H+ gradient powers transporter that pulls NT in
  * Finally, vesicles get placed in storage pod via synapsin holding them to cytoskeleton
* Some neurotransmitters
  * Amino acids - glutamate, GABA, glycine
  * Biogenic amines - histamine, Seratonin, catecholamines(Doplamine, epinepherine, norepinepherine, octopamine)
  * Peptides - 100s of peptide nt such as substance P(used at pain and temp receptors), opioids - endorphins
  * Other - ACH, gasses (NO,CO)
  * ATP
* Synthesis pathways
  * ACh is made from choline + acetyl CoA, broken down into these by AChE
  * Amino acid transmitters - glutamine->glutamate->GABA
  * Biogenic Amines - tyrosine->doplamine->norepinepherine->epinepherine
  * peptides - transcribed /translated into (usually) a large precursor which is cleaved to give the functional peptide.
* **Axoplasmic transport** - move items through the neuron
  * **anterograde** - movement from cell body to terminal, slow or fast
    * **Slow axoplasmic transport(anterograde)** - uses cytoplasm and moves large cytoskeleton elements along microtubeles at a rate of .5mm/day
    * **Fast axoplasmic transport(anterograde)** - 400mm per day, moves vesicles down microtubule tracts, uses _kinesin_
  * **retrograde** - from terminal to cell body, one speed. Uses motor protein _dynein_
    * **dynein** - hydrolyzes ATP for a conformational change to step along microtubule.
  * microtubeles have a polarity that kinesin and dynein use for going their specific directions.
  * vesicle membrane is tagged with a "shipping label" a olecule that will bind it to either kinesin or dynein
  * somehow neuron can regulate this transport
  * **synaptic integration** - a neuron receives inputs from several different neurons at a time, the interplay of all its inputs determines whether that neuron crosses threshold and fires an AP.
  * **Spike initiation zone** - right at the beginning of axon next to cell body, generally where AP is started, where threshold is lowest since it has a high conc of Na+ v-gated  channel
  * PSP out on a dendrite spreads passively through terminal.
  * The neuron declines in amplitude dep on space constant (time constant) cable properties.
  * The farther the synapse is from the SIZ, the smaller will be the psp when it reaches the SIZ - also depends on things like Rm, Ri, Cm in the neuron where the synapse is located to the SIZ
  * for lambda (space constant), a high Rm and a low Ri would help spread PSP with less decline in amplitude to the SIZ.
  * for tau, a long time constant means the AP would last longer, and would be more likely to sum/add to other PSP's from various distances
  * At the same time all the epsps are coming to te SIZ, IPSPs are also. All of the PSPs at a given point in time at the SIZ will determine wheter the neuron crosses threshold and fires an AP
  * **Spacial summation** -PSPs whos amplitudes are addected by how far they have traveled (space constant), how they all add up
  * **temporal summation** - how large those PSPs are at a particular time that is determined by the time constant.
* Drugs with presynaptic effects
  * **Cocaine** - presynaptic effects, Blocks dopamine transporter
  * **Methanphetamine** - presynaptic effects, causes transporter to "run backward", dumping dopamine from terminal into synaptic cleft -even without it being in vesicles
  * **Ritalin** - presynaptic effects, interferes(blocks) dopamine transporter, perhaps can be used to treat cocaine addiction
  * KO mice missing doplamine transporter, hyperactive like on cocaine but insensitive to cocaine. 100x prolonged presence of doplamine in synapse.
    * Doplamine is actually not a common transmitter in the brain. Found in 2 pathways:
      1. **Nigrostantal pathway** - from substantia nigra , for motor control, cells in substantia nigra die in parkinsons
      2. **Ventral tegmental**- area to nucleus accumbens - the pleasure circuit. Relevant for drug abuse
  * **Seratonin transporter in presynaptic terminal** - antidepressents may interfere with transporter, leaving Seratonin in synapse longer. Zoloft, Paxtil, Prozac
  * **Ecstasy** - presynaptic effects, MDMA Feels best first time around, next day pain threshold is lower. Causes seratonin transporter to work backwards, causes 80% of brain seratonin to be dumped
    * runs backwards - instead of transporter picking up into cell and removing, dumps into synapse.
* Drugs with postsynaptic effects
  * **Nicotine** - postsynaptic effects, binds ACh receptors in ventral tegmented cells (which are dopaminergic), stimulating the to release more dopamine into the nucleus accumbens.
    * ACh is released from a presynaptic cell to the ventral tegmented cell, Nicotine acts on the ACh receptor in the ventral tegmental cell to stimulate it (but its postsynaptic to the source of ACh)
    * When ventral tegmenteal cell is stimulated it releases more dopamine into the synapse at the nucleus accumbens.
  * **opiates** - postsynaptic effects, bind at pre existing endorphin receptors on certain cells. Pain relief in spinal cord where binds at receptors on cells receiving input from pain receptors. Tones down response. Its a G-Protein mediated system. Geroin crosses BBB more easily than morphine so its more effective.
    * But for addiction/pleasure path, block receptors on the dopaminergic cells of ventral tegmental areathat are receptors for GABA and normally act to supress activity of the cells.
    * Opiates inhibit this inhibition - So these cells are more active and release more dopamine in the nucleus accumbens.
  * **Marajuana** - Active ingredient THC, binds a receptor already there. THC type receptors are in peripheral tissues - have been clones but in brain has not yet
  * **Alcohol** - Nonspecific, passes through BBB easily. Seems to block GABA-ergic input  to doplamine cells in ventral tegmental area, but also goes everywhere else.
      * inhibits v-gated Ca++ channels to inhibit n.t. release, reduces activation of cAMP
      * GABA-enhancing drugs, are tranquiizers
  * **Psychadelic drugs** - Postsynaptic effects, structurally similar to serotinin, especially som to doplamine. Bind to serotonin type 2A receptors to stimulate or interfere with them. Include LSD, psilocybin, mescaline, bufoterine.
    * 1943 Hoffman - Synthesized and applied LSD to rats, saw no effect so took it himself and described effects. Got psilocybin from certain mushrooms, no effects from rats so he tried it himself.
    * 1950's - tried to make truth serum
    * 1960's - timothy leary gave LSD and other hallucionogenic drugs bad rep, research basically stopped.
    * Shows promise for PTSD and depression -
  * **Ethnobotany** - Wade Davis (student) collected 'zombie powder', one sample had TTX.
  * **Clavius Narcisse**
  * **Facilitation** - synaptic strength increases when the synapse is stimulated several times in quick succession.
    * Presyn cell - stimulus looks like ---|-----|-|-|-|------|---- (burst)
    * Postsyn cell PSP's- response (increasing amplitude with each ap of the burst)
    * **Homosynaptic facilitation** - one synapse, see affect on postsynaptic cell. presynaptic terminal has the effect of: the Ca++ that enters each time the presunaptic cell is stimulated lingers in the presynaptic terminal, so if another stimulus arrives before the Ca++ is cleared from the terminal, that Ca__vadds to the new influx of Ca++ from the next stimulus, there is more Ca++ in the terminal so more cesicles are released. This leads to a larger psp in the postsynaptic cell. Not all presynaptic terminals do this.
    (IMG)
      * heterosynaptic facilitation uses 3 neurons, 2 synapses. Synapse between test and recorded cell has some effect when test fires Test cell synapses with record cell, priming cell synapses with test's cell terminal. When priming is activated, releases neuromodulator that asserts effect on test cell. and when test cell is stimulated again, its release of nt is altered.
        * neuromodulater could make channels easier or harder to open, NA+ or K+ or Ca++
      * These all affect the strength of the synapse between the test cell and the recorded cell
      * there can be heterosynapctic and homosynaptic facilitation and depression, depending on the effect
        * stronger response - facilitation
        * depression - weaker response in recorded neuron
      * Posttetonic potentiation at single synapse.
      (img)
        * pre : -|------|||||---------|---
          * First AP, then synapse burst of AP, then wait 10 min, then one AP
        * post : -(small)----(increasing amplitute psp's) --------- (large PSP)
        * How? Ca++ enters duting the AP in presynaptic terminal. When presynaptic cell shows a burst of activity, there is some buildup of Ca++ in the terminal, so some  inc in nt release and amplitude of postsynaptic cell Ca++ gets sequestered into mitochondria and ER. But then over the next 10 min or so the Ca++ leaks out of the organelles and so builds up in the terminal over several min so that if the presynaptic cell is stimulated after this, theres lots of Ca++ and lots of nt that is released. Not all synapses do this!
