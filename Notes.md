## Neuromodulation
* **Neuromodulation** - Molecules that act on nerves to enhance or inhibit nerves
  * Related in presynaptic cell, cross cleft, bind to receptors on post syn cells but not linked to ion channels
  * Activates 2nd messenger that leads to a change in ion channel like channel opening or closing, or easier or harder to open v-gated channel
* Neuromodulation is slower to activate than neurotransmitter activity. It can also last longer.
* **Neuromodular** - indirect transmitter, lignad binds to metabotropic receptor, using g protein activates ion channel to open in
* Direct transmitter - ligand binds to channel to open it
* **G-proteins** - modulator binds to a receptor = _metabotropic receptor_. Bound receptor becomes activated and activates a G-Protein. Can lead to complex biochemical cascades
* **Metabotrophic receptors structurally** - have 7 transmembrane spanning regions. Have carboxy tail inside, amino terminus outside, binding site outside, bonding site for g-protein inside, phosphorylation sites which when phosphorylated, desensitize the membrane. Some are on carboxyl tail
1. transmitter/modulator binds at its receptor (specific)
2. on the inside, the receptor was bound to a G protein, when the neurotransmitter binds to the receptor, the f protein is activated.
3. G has 3 subinits, a,b,gamma, and bind GDP. sheds GDP, binds to GTP instead. At the same time, the g protein splits and the a subunit seperates from the b and gamma. Active.
4. Subunits, a and bg subunits go on to do things
5. a subunit is a GTPase, GTP -> GDP
6. a-GDP reassembles with bg and reforms the g protein. Also the receptor itself can desensitize and not bind anymore
* **Activated subunits can do many things**
* Muscarinic ACh receptor in the heart is metabotropic
* here the activated g proteins bg subunit binds directly to a K+ channel and conformationally opens channel, brings down membrane potential to slow down heartrate
* Experiment: apply ACh to the outside of a heart muscle membrane - in patch clamp lost of outward current. then find that using an inside out patch clamp apply activated bg subunit _only_ to inside of membrane
* see the same effect as applyinf ACH to outside
* Other metabotrophic systems are more complex
* the activated G protein subunits may activate second messenger biochemical cascades
* 2nd messengers include cAMP, cGMP, NO, Ca++, lipids like DAG, IP3
* may activate adenyl cyclase which makes cAMP and the cAMP can activate things
* for example: Activated Gprotein subunits may activate adente maylyl cyclase which then produces cAMP
* cAMP will activate a protein kinase, protein kinase puts a phosphate on to a protein (phosphorylates the protein) the phosphorylate dprotein could be an ion channel
* To terminate the activity:  
* the phosphate may be removed from the channel by a protein phosphatase
* cAMP can be broken down by _phosphosterase_
* if cAMP is high enough and long enough, can get changes in gene expression (Make more ion channels? or receptors for that molecule)
* Another 2nd messenger system
* in this example the end result is a Ca++ channel is phosphorylated and closed
1. Modulator binds to a receptor on membrane
2. Activated receptor activates a G-Protein
3. Activated G-Protein binds to GTP, splits into alpha-GTP and bg subunits.
Inside the cell membrane is an enzyme, Phospholipase C. Both subunits of G-Protein bind here.

* Variations on this pathway
* PIP2 can open/close channels
* intracellular Ca++ can lead to channels opening/closing or other things
* Why such an complex system?
* amplifies signal
* effect can last a while (seconds or hours)
* if active long enough, can make permanent changes through gene activation
* an activated receptor at one location can effect changes throughout the neuron. Single neuromodulator can create an exponential amount of target proteins
* Final step is to get the modulator off the receptor to inactivate the cascade
* For neuro-transmitter or modulators, enzymes include:
* for ACh => acetylcholine esterase AchE
* for monoamines like Seratonin, Doplamine => monoamine oxidase MAO
* Diffusion away from the postsynaptic cell also negative effect
* Re-uptake mechanisms:
  * presynaptic cell membrane take up transmitter or modulator and returns it to the presynaptic terminal for reuse

## Neurotransmitter release from pre-synaptic terminal
* Chemical synapses have a synaptic delay. (.5 msec)
* temperature sensitive, warmer is faster
* indicates delay involves more than time for diffusion (Diffusion estimated to take.5 msec)
* must take soe time to release the neurotransmitter
* Katz and Miledi 1960's - treat neuromuscular junction with small doses of TTX; find that postsynaptic potentials hae a minimum amplitude. PSPs are multiples of that minimum amplitude
* **minature endplate potential** - Minimum amplitude, aka mini quantal units. Equal to the release of one packet of neurotransmitters (1 vesicle).
* Continuing applying TTX to block all Na channels, then electrically(artificially using electrodes) stimulate presynaptic cell, still see PSPs in muscle.
* Can use TTX and TEA, still get transmitter release when electrically stimulate
* So : Na+ or K+ not needed, although depolarization is needed
* But: if Ca++ is removed from extracellular bath, no transmitter is released.
* Normally, a.p. in presynaptic cell reaches the terminal. The depolarization causes
* voltage gated Ca++ channels to open
* Ca++ enters to the point that [Ca++]in terminal can increase 200x
* Ca++ sensitive dyes in presynaptic terminals show this increase can be used to map stuff out active synapses
* Nitrophen makes 'caged Ca+' it binds it in the terminal - it will release the Ca++ when exposed to UV light
  * presynaptic cell injected w/ nitrophan
  * record postsynaptic cell
  * treat presynaptic cell q/ UV light no depolarization needed
  * Postsynaptic cell shows an epp
  * Therefore,  inc Ca++ can lead to nt release
* Can get epp to minimum size by lowering [Ca++]out (one pack of nt released)
* How much nt is in a single packet?
  * Calculated 7000 in single quantum, need about 2600 to open 1300 channel which is what is seen in a mini
  * rest of ACh must get broken down by AChE or diffuses away
  * For a 'typical' epsp at frog nm junction, there are about 200 quanta released - so a typical epsp opens 2600 channels at one synapse for frog nm junction
  1. presynaptic terminal depolarizes
  2. v-Ca++ channels open
  3. ... Stuff ... covered below
  4. NT is released
  * In presynaptic terminal, there are 2 populations of vesicles
    * Releasable pool - ready to fuse to terminal membtane to release nt into cleft
    * Storage pool - bound to cytoskeleton by _synapsin_
    * When terminal depolarizes, Ca++influx activates a protein kinase which phosphorylates synapsin causing it to undergo conformation change releasing the vesicles it holds to the cytoskeleton
  * to get vesicles to release contents, proteins on vesicle membrane v-SNARES bind to proteins on the terminal membrane T-SNARES and a fusion pore is created and contents are released (DOCKING)
    * after release, vesicle must be recycled
  * On the vesicle (proteins):
    * **Synaptotagmin** - Ca++ dependent step. Binds 5 Ca++ ions, senses Ca++ levels and promotes vesicle docking. it inhibits some molecular clamp on the SNARE complex (t-snares + v-snares) allowing it to form - or allowing T-SNARES to interact with v-SNARES
    * **Synaptobrerin(VAMP)**
  * on the terminal:
    * Syntaxin
    * Snap-25
    * Associated with syntaxin is Munc-18 -  an essential protein that catalyzes the binding of the SNARE complex, precise function is not known.
  * Once the vesicle is bound to the terminal using the SNARE complex, Fusion pore forms- passage between inside of vesicle and outside of terminal so nt can be released
  * don't know how it's made
  * after dumping contents must get off the terminal membrane so another can bind
  * 2 proteins used to dissassemble the SNARE compelex are
    * NSF
    * SNAP
  * Tetanus toxin - cleaves synoptobrevin
  * Botulnum toxins - one type cleaves syntaxin and SNAP-25
  * Black widow spider venom -  active ingredient makes a pore in presynaptic terminal so there is a massive Ca++ influx and massive dumping of NT. Entire vesicles
  * Final step is recycling the vesicle - there is a rapid endocytosis of membtane around empty vesicle making an endosome.
  * new vesicles are made from the endosome, clatherin is a protein that coats new vesicles. Clatherin is then removed so vesicle can be refilled.
  * Refilling - nt works with a specific transporter that is powered by a proton pump -> uses ATP to fill vesicle with H+, H+ gradient powers transporter that pulls NT in
  * Finally, vesicles get placed in storage pod via synapsin holding them to cytoskeleton
* Some neurotransmitters
  * Amino acids - glutamate, GABA, glycine
  * Biogenic amines - histamine, Seratonin, catecholamines(Doplamine, epinepherine, norepinepherine, octopamine)
  * Peptides - 100s of peptide nt such as substance P(used at pain and temp receptors), opioids - endorphins
  * Other - ACH, gasses (NO,CO)
  * ATP
* Synthesis pathways
  * ACh is made from choline + acetyl CoA, broken down into these by AChE
  * Amino acid transmitters - glutamine->glutamate->GABA
  * Biogenic Amines - tyrosine->doplamine->norepinepherine->epinepherine
  * peptides - transcribed /translated into (usually) a large precursor which is cleaved to give the functional peptide.
* **Axoplasmic transport** - move items through the neuron
  * **anterograde** - movement from cell body to terminal, slow or fast
    * **Slow axoplasmic transport(anterograde)** - uses cytoplasm and moves large cytoskeleton elements along microtubeles at a rate of .5mm/day
    * **Fast axoplasmic transport(anterograde)** - 400mm per day, moves vesicles down microtubule tracts, uses _kinesin_
  * **retrograde** - from terminal to cell body, one speed. Uses motor protein _dynein_
    * **dynein** - hydrolyzes ATP for a conformational change to step along microtubule.
  * microtubeles have a polarity that kinesin and dynein use for going their specific directions.
  * vesicle membrane is tagged with a "shipping label" a olecule that will bind it to either kinesin or dynein
  * somehow neuron can regulate this transport
  * **synaptic integration** - a neuron receives inputs from several different neurons at a time, the interplay of all its inputs determines whether that neuron crosses threshold and fires an AP.
  * **Spike initiation zone** - right at the beginning of axon next to cell body, generally where AP is started, where threshold is lowest since it has a high conc of Na+ v-gated  channel
  * PSP out on a dendrite spreads passively through terminal.
  * The neuron declines in amplitude dep on space constant (time constant) cable properties.
  * The farther the synapse is from the SIZ, the smaller will be the psp when it reaches the SIZ - also depends on things like Rm, Ri, Cm in the neuron where the synapse is located to the SIZ
  * for lambda (space constant), a high Rm and a low Ri would help spread PSP with less decline in amplitude to the SIZ.
  * for tau, a long time constant means the AP would last longer, and would be more likely to sum/add to other PSP's from various distances
  * At the same time all the epsps are coming to te SIZ, IPSPs are also. All of the PSPs at a given point in time at the SIZ will determine wheter the neuron crosses threshold and fires an AP
  * **Spacial summation** -PSPs whos amplitudes are addected by how far they have traveled (space constant), how they all add up
  * **temporal summation** - how large those PSPs are at a particular time that is determined by the time constant.
