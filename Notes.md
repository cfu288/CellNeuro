* 2 types of ganglion cells (in primates):
  * **p Cells** - small receptive fields, high spacial resolution, color sensitive. info from fovea
  * **m Cells** - Large receptive fields, sensitive to contrast, sensitive to movement not color. Not fovea
  * P cells get info from fovea, m cells from other parts of the retina
* **Brain and the Lateral Geniculate**
  * projections from retina cross the midline at the optic chiasm
    * (most of) right eye axons to left side of brain in primates, all axons in others
      * important in depth perception
    * axons that receive inputs from the left half of the visual field from each eye will join up together in the right lateral geniculate.
    (IMG)
    * Images from the right half of the vision field will fall on the Lateral side of the left retina and nasal side of right retina and the inputs from the left eye do not cross at the chiasm axons from the right eye do creoss at the chiasm and both meet up in the left lateral geniculate (LGN)
  * Organization of the LGN   
    * retina is mapped out in  a topographic map of the world
    * 6 layers in the LGN, each layer has the topographic map, each map are stacked in perfect register.
      * in other words, if experimentally you stick an electrode through theLGN, go straight through all 6 layers, all the cells you records will respond to the stimuli in the same place of the receptive field. Extra representation of the fovea.
    * Layers 1/2 contain large **magnocellular cells** - They receive synapses from M ganglion cells.
    * Layers 3-6 have smaller cells called **parvocellular cells** - receive input from P cells of retina
      * **layers 1,4,6** - from the contralateral eye
      * **Layers 2,3,5** - from ipsilateral eye
    * M layer cells of layer 1/2 are not color sensitive, are sensitive to contrasts and motion
    * P cells of layers 3-6 are color sensitive, high resolution.  Layers may see same part of the world but sensitive to different colors, 3 and 5 will have differnt color sensitivities for example.
    * Each cell in LGN has a particular piece of information that it can pass on to the next level of processing.
    * But: only 25% of input to LGN is from retina, 75%comes from visual cortex and brainstem. What is it doing?
    * LGN axons travel to visual cortex in occipital lobe.
    * terminate in a specific stop
      * primary visual cortex.
        * V1
        * area 17
        * striate cortex
      * about 2mm thick, organized into 6 layers
      * LGN axons project to layer 4. Depending on which layer from LGN go to diferent sublayers
        * different sublayers for magnocellular parvocellular
      * Each layer of visual cortex has topographic map, large portion dedicated to fovea
    * **Cells of visual cortex**
      * **simple cell** - recives LGN inputs, found in layer 4. Have receptive fields with on center or off center, surround responses are opposite to center. Receptive field is in shape of bar. Var has specific orientation that is preferred.
      * input comes from several LGN cells which all have receptive fields that are next to each other so centers line up in a bar - all of the centers ave same on or off response.
      * Simple cell responds with up or down in firing frequency;
      * outputs of simple cells in layer 4 go to layers 2+3 where the **complex cells** - are sensitive to edges w/ particular orientation. Can be anywhere in receptive field.
      * Can be anywhere in receptive field so inputs come from several simple cells that all have the same preferred orientation fir the bar of light
          * some complex cells like edges that move.
      * Organization of primary visual cortex layers.
        * topographic map in each
        * orientation colums - cells in all layers in a vertical column have the same preferred orientation for light bars (or edges)
        * over a min or so, all possible orientations are represented.
      * Ocular dominance columns
        * each eye is represented in alternating bands of cells.
      * Color sensitivity in set of cells, call this collection of color sensitive cells a blob.
      * info from primary visual cortex gets sent to other layers of the cortex for "further processing"
    * Depth perception
      * Need two eyes that have some overlap in receptive fields
      * Look at a point on 3D object points that are art of this object that are in front and behind **fixation point**
      * points that are part of this object that are in front and behind fixation point will fall on slightly different places on the 2 retinas
      * this disparity is sensed by specific cells in the brain binocular disparity cells which interpret the images as part of one structure but in 3d
      * if disparities are too far apart, you will see 2 images
    * **Auditory system**
      * **Sound intensity** - measured in decibels, measured in logs
      * 0db - below what you can hear
      * 20 db - whisper
      * 30 db - 10x louder than 20
      * 40 db - 100x louder than 20
      * Jet engine - 160db
      * rock concert - 119-140
      * **sound frequency** - number of cycles per second (Hz)
        * human hearing: 20 - 20khz
        * sound is propogated through air as compression of air molecules alternating with rarefaction t a particular distance to or wavelength
      * The ear
        * **Outer ear** - pinna - shape for localizing sound
            * ripples for localizing sound in vertical plane, point forward  for front-back.
          * shape + ripples help amplify specific sounds, 3-4k range, most human speech.
        * **Middle ear** - Eardrum + ossicles
          * ossicles = 3 bones, incus, malleus, stapes
          * Sound hit eardrum which moves ossicles, stapes pushes inner ear
        * **Inner ear** - cochlea - coiled tube 35mm long
          * flexible partition down center dividing it into 2 chambers
            * upper - **scala vestibuli**
            * lower - **scala tympani**
          * partition supports
            * **basilar membrane**
            * **tectorial membrane**
          * **Cochlea end nearest the ossicles**
            * basil end has 2 memrane covered holes.
            * oval window - stapes attaches
            * round window
          * **apical end of cochlea**
            * Partition does not go all the way to the end, called heliocotrema, so s.vestibuli and tympani are not sealed from each other.
            * sitting on the **basilar membrane** - are the sensory neurons = hair cells
              * **hair cells** - have cilia on the top of the cell, looked like someone snipped the hairs at an angle.
                * longest hair is called a kinocillium and the others are called stereocillia. No axons.
                * hair cells do not fire ap. Do not have axons. Synapse with auditory neurons signals are graded changes in Vm.
                * 2 sets of hair cells
                  * **inner hair cells** - what detect sound. 95% of sensory neurons for our ear are these.
                  * **outer hair cells** - more of them. 75% of total hair population. receive input from brain.
                * Hairs are either stuck into or rest on the tectorial membrane of them.
                * Hair cells are stimulated when
                  * sound waves push the eardrum, stapes pushes oval window of cochlea.
                  * cochlea is filled with fluid, stapes pushes to make waves.
                  * waves travel length of cochlea (s.vestibuli), go down helicotrema, through s.tymphani hit round window.
                  * fluid waves move basilar membrane
                  * moves hair cells cell bodies
                  * hairs are in the tectorial membrane so hairs are bent.
                  * bending of hairs leads to sensory transduction occurs.
                * Structure of basilar membrane is such that **high freq motion in the cochlea** - causes the basilar membrane to move most at basal end.
                  * **low freq** - move more at apical end
                * Also: hairs are constructed to be shorter and stiffer at basal end of cochlea, longer more flexible at apical end
                * **Mechanical tuning** - in cochlea, Short and stiff respond better to high freq, long flexible to low freq
        * **sensory transduction**
          * as basil membrane moves up and down, hair cells hairs are bend first one way then the other.
          * At the tips of the hairs are thin filaments
          * tiplinks run between hair tips.
            * **tiplinks** - connected to ion channels which are on the tip of the hair. When stereocilia move torwatd kinocilium, they stretch the tip links and open ion channels, hair cell depolarizes. When stereocilia move opposite direction, (away from kino), tiplinks relax, ion channels close, hair cell hyperpolarizes.
            * **When basilar membrane moves up** - during rarefaction phase of sound 'wave' the stereocilia move toward the kinocilium and the hair cell depolarizes.
            * **when the basilar membrane moves down** - during compression of the sound 'wave', stereocilia move away from the kinocilium, ion channel closes, hair cell hyperpolarizes
            * no sound - in between.
            (IMG from phone)
            * **What ions depolarize the hair cells?** + ion enters - K+. Hair cells are inside their own chamber, Scala media. Really high K+ conc outside cell, flows in
            (IMG from phone)
            * So as hair cells move up and down and k+ channels or hair tips open then close s.tympani which the base of hair cells is in, has a more typical ionic composition, so:
              * as K+ enters hair top, hair depol, activates v-Ca++ channels which open. Ca++ enters, hair cell releases n.t.
              * On basal end of hair cells, this inc [Ca++]in opens Ca++ activated K+ channels.
            * here, K+ exits the cell. this brings Vm back to starting calue and then as motion of hair cell moves below starting position, more K+ cehannels on the hair tips are closed than at rest  
          * so Vm hyperpolarizes due to K+ exiting the basal portion of the cell
        * Vmrest 0> K+ enters hair tip, starts to depolarize, vgated Ca++ open, NT released, at peak Ca++ activated open on cell base(starts to hyper pol), More channels on hair tip are closed than at rest(when hyperpolarized), K+ exiting ca++ actin K+ channels.
        (IMG)
        * Vm follows the freq that sound is moving basilar membrane.
        * **Electrical tuning**:
          * anotger form of electrical tuning,
            * The ca++ activated K+ channels are also called big K channels or bK
            * when may open, K+ exits, Vm drops
            * bK channels are different in gK(conductance to K) depending on which hair cell they are on
              * for high freq hair cells, gK+ for bK channel is high so K+ exits quickly and Vm can change quicly.
              * For low freq hairs, gK+ for bK channels is much lower and Vm changes more slowly
        * **Active tuning**:
          * Outer hair cell:
            * hairs of these cells have motor protein called **prestin** - charged protein that reacts to changes in membrane potential. When Vm becomes (+), prestin shortens. When Vm, becomes +, it lengthenes, when it becomes -, it relaxes.
            * When Vm becomes (+), as basilar membrane moves up, prestin shortens, outer hair cells pull basilar membrane up just a little more.
            * Sharpen tuning
          * **Damage to outer hair cells** - leads to trouble discriminating sounds. Can still hear you, but its hard to make out what you're saying.
          * Outer hair cells receive inputs from superior olive of brain
            * these are Ach inputs. Are inhibitory
          * Ach receptors are ionotrophic, open a channel for Na+ and Ca++. The Ca++ that enters activates the Ca++ activated K+ channels which open, prolong the hyperpolarization of the outer hair cell and keep it from shortening.
          * So basilar membrane motion can be turned down at a particular frequency. This happens if there is a sound that is particularly loud at that frequency.
            * avoids over stimulation of basilar membrane and inner hair cells at a particular frequency.
      * Hair cells synapse with auditory neurons cell bodies in spinal ganglion near the cochlea, send long proccess to hair cells to receive n.t.
      * auditory neurons are tuned to frequency by which hair cells they receive input from
      * auditory neurons fire a.p. Fire when stimulated a big stimulus means lots of spikes, a lesser or one of freqencies from other hair cells that they do not receive input from, dont fire.
      * **Tuning curve** - describes auditory neuron's response on graph. Plot threshold on X, freq on y. Minimum response to generate a response as function of frequency of sound.
      (IMG)
        * Peak shows the best frequency. This is the frequency where the cell has the lowest threshold.
        * Sharp curve - narrowly tuned
        * Broad curve - Broadly tuned
      * tuning depends on which hair cells they receive inputs from.
      *
