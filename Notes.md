## Neuromodulation
* **Neuromodulation** - Molecules that act on nerves to enhance or inhibit nerves
  * Related in presynaptic cell, cross cleft, bind to receptors on post syn cells but not linked to ion channels
  * Activates 2nd messenger that leads to a change in ion channel like channel opening or closing, or easier or harder to open v-gated channel
* Neuromodulation is slower to activate than neurotransmitter activity. It can also last longer.
* **Neuromodular** - indirect transmitter, ligand binds to metabotropic receptor, using g protein activates ion channel to open in
* **Direct transmitter** - ligand binds to channel to open it
* **G-proteins** - modulator binds to a receptor = _metabotropic receptor_. Bound receptor becomes activated and activates a G-Protein. Can lead to complex biochemical cascades
* **Metabotrophic receptors structurally** - have 7 transmembrane spanning regions. Have carboxy tail inside, amino terminus outside, binding site outside, bonding site for g-protein inside, phosphorylation sites which when phosphorylated, desensitize the membrane. Some are on carboxyl tail
  1. transmitter/modulator binds at its receptor (specific)
  2. on the inside, the receptor was bound to a G protein, when the neurotransmitter binds to the receptor, the f protein is activated.
  3. G has 3 subunits, a,b,gamma, and bind GDP. Sheds GDP, binds to GTP instead. At the same time, the g protein splits and the a subunit separates from the b and gamma. Active.
  4. Subunits, a and bg subunits go on to do things
  5. **a subunit** - is a GTPase, GTP -> GDP
  6. a-GDP reassembles with bg and reforms the g protein. Also the receptor itself can desensitize and not bind anymore
* **Activated subunits can do many things**
* **Muscarinic ACh receptor in the heart** - is metabotropic, activated g proteins bg subunit binds directly to a K+ channel and conformationally opens channel, brings down membrane potential to slow down heartrate
* Experiment: apply ACh to the outside of a heart muscle membrane - in patch clamp lost of outward current. then find that using an inside out patch clamp apply activated bg subunit _only_ to inside of membrane
* see the same effect as applyinf ACH to outside
* Other metabotrophic systems are more complex
* the activated G protein subunits may activate second messenger biochemical cascades
  * **2nd messengers include** - cAMP, cGMP, NO, Ca++, lipids like DAG, IP3
  * may activate **adenyl cyclase** - makes cAMP and the cAMP can activate things
  * for example: Activated G-protein subunits may activate adenyl  cyclase which then produces cAMP
  * **cAMP** - will activate a protein kinase,
  * **protein kinase** - (phosphorylates the protein) the phosphorylated protein could be an ion channel
* **To terminate the activity** - remove phosphate, break down cAMP  
  * the phosphate may be removed from the channel by a protein phosphatase
  * cAMP can be broken down by _phosphosterase_
  * **if cAMP is high enough and long enough** - can get changes in gene expression (Make more ion channels? or receptors for that molecule)
* **Ca++ 2nd messenger system** - Ca++ channel is phosphorylated and closed. Modulator binds to a receptor -> activates a G-Protein -> G-Protein binds to GTP, splits into alpha-GTP and bg subunits which bind to Phospholipase C
  1. Modulator binds to a receptor on membrane
  2. Activated receptor activates a G-Protein
  3. Activated G-Protein binds to GTP, splits into alpha-GTP and bg subunits.
  Inside the cell membrane is an enzyme, Phospholipase C. Both subunits of G-Protein bind here.
![pathway](/Images/path1.png)
* Variations on this pathway
* **PIP2** - can open/close channels
* **intracellular Ca++** - can lead to channels opening/closing or other things
* **Why such an complex system?** - amplifies signal, lasts longer, causes gene activation
  * amplifies signal
  * effect can last a while (seconds or hours)
  * if active long enough, can make permanent changes through gene activation
  * an activated receptor at one location can effect changes throughout the neuron. Single neuromodulator can create an exponential amount of target proteins
* Final step is to get the modulator off the receptor to inactivate the cascade
* **Inactivate cascade of neuro-transmitter or modulators** enzymes include:
* for **ACh inactivation** - acetylcholine esterase AchE
* for **monoamines inactivation like Seratonin, Doplamine** - monoamine oxidase MAO
* Diffusion away from the postsynaptic cell also negative effect
* Re-uptake mechanisms:
  * presynaptic cell membrane take up transmitter or modulator and returns it to the presynaptic terminal for reuse

## Neurotransmitter release from pre-synaptic terminal
* Chemical synapses have a synaptic delay. (.5 msec)
* temperature sensitive, warmer is faster
* indicates delay involves more than time for diffusion (Diffusion estimated to take.5 msec)
* must take some time to release the neurotransmitter
* Katz and Miledi 1960's - treat neuromuscular junction with small doses of TTX; find that postsynaptic potentials hae a minimum amplitude. PSPs are multiples of that minimum amplitude
  * **minature endplate potential** - Minimum amplitude, aka mini quantal units. Equal to the release of one packet of neurotransmitters (1 vesicle).
  * Continuing applying TTX to block all Na channels, then electrically(artificially using electrodes) stimulate presynaptic cell, still see PSPs in muscle.
  * Can use TTX and TEA, _still get transmitter release when electrically stimulated_
  * So : _Na+ or K+ not needed_, although depolarization is needed
  * But: if Ca++ is removed from extracellular bath, no transmitter is released.
* Normally, a.p. in presynaptic cell reaches the terminal. The depolarization causes voltage gated Ca++ channels to open
* Ca++ enters to the point that [Ca++]in terminal can increase 200x
* Ca++ sensitive dyes in presynaptic terminals show this increase can be used to map stuff out active synapses
* **Nitrophen** - makes 'caged Ca+' it binds it in the terminal - it will release the Ca++ when exposed to UV light. used to test Ca++ and nt release in presynaptic cell. Can use to release only one quantum of nt.
  * presynaptic cell injected w/ nitrophan
  * record postsynaptic cell
  * treat presynaptic cell q/ UV light no depolarization needed
  * Postsynaptic cell shows an epp
  * Therefore,  inc Ca++ can lead to nt release
  * Can get epp to minimum size by lowering [Ca++]out (one pack of nt released)
* **How much nt is in a single packet?** - Calculated 7000 in single quantum, need about 2600 to open 1300 channel which is what is seen in a mini
  * rest of ACh must get broken down by AChE or diffuses away
  * For a 'typical' epsp at frog nm junction, there are about 200 quanta/vesicles released - so a typical epsp opens 2600 channels at one synapse for frog nm junction
  1. presynaptic terminal depolarizes
  2. v-Ca++ channels open
  3. ... Stuff ... covered below
  4. NT is released
  * In presynaptic terminal, there are 2 populations of vesicles
    * **Releasable pool** - ready to fuse to terminal membrane to release nt into cleft
    * **Storage pool** - bound to cytoskeleton by _synapsin_
    * When terminal depolarizes, Ca++ influx activates a protein kinase which phosphorylates synapsin causing it to undergo conformation change releasing the vesicles it holds to the cytoskeleton
  * to get vesicles to release contents, proteins on vesicle membrane v-SNARES bind to proteins on the terminal membrane T-SNARES and a fusion pore is created and contents are released (DOCKING)
    * after release, vesicle must be recycled
  * On the vesicle (_V-SNARE proteins_):
    * **Synaptotagmin** - V-SNARE protein.Ca++ dependent step, Ca++ sensor. Binds 5 Ca++ ions, senses Ca++ levels and promotes vesicle docking. it inhibits some molecular clamp on the SNARE complex (t-snares + v-snares) allowing it to form - or allowing T-SNARES to interact with v-SNARES. Starts vesicle cleaving.
    * **Synaptobrevin(VAMP)** - V-SNARE protein
  * on the terminal (_T-SNARE_):
    * **Syntaxin** - T-SNARE
    * **Snap-25** - T-SNARE
    * **Associated with syntaxin is Munc-18** - T-SNARE, an essential protein that catalyzes the binding of the SNARE complex, precise function is not known.
  * Once the vesicle is bound to the terminal using the SNARE complex, Fusion pore forms- passage between inside of vesicle and outside of terminal so nt can be released
  * don't know how it's made
  * after dumping contents must get off the terminal membrane so another can bind
  * 2 proteins used to dissassemble the SNARE compelex are
    * **NSF** - dissassemble the SNARE compelex
    * **SNAP** - dissassemble the SNARE compelex
  * **Tetanus toxin** - cleaves synoptobrevin (V-SNARE protein)
  * **Botulnum toxins** - one type cleaves syntaxin and SNAP-25 (T-Snare proteins)
  * **Black widow spider venom** -  active ingredient makes a pore in presynaptic terminal so there is a massive Ca++ influx and massive dumping of NT. Entire vesicles
  * Final step is **recycling the vesicle** - there is a rapid endocytosis of membrane around empty vesicle making an endosome.
  * **new vesicles are made from the** - endosome,
  * **clatherin** - is a protein that coats new vesicles. Clatherin is then removed so vesicle can be refilled.
  * **Refilling** - nt works with a specific transporter that is powered by a proton pump -> uses ATP to fill vesicle with H+, H+ gradient powers transporter that pulls NT in. After refillrf placed in storage pool
  * Finally, vesicles get placed in storage pool via synapsin holding them to cytoskeleton
* Some neurotransmitters
  * **Amino acids NT** - glutamate, GABA, glycine
  * **Biogenic amines NT** - histamine, Seratonin, catecholamines(Doplamine, epinepherine, norepinepherine, octopamine)
  * **Peptides NT** - 100s of peptide nt such as substance P(used at pain and temp receptors), opioids - endorphins
  * **Other NT** - ACH, gasses (NO,CO)
  * **ATP** can act as NT
* Synthesis pathways
  * ACh is made from choline + acetyl CoA, broken down into these by AChE
  * Amino acid transmitters - glutamine->glutamate->GABA
  * Biogenic Amines - tyrosine->doplamine->norepinepherine->epinepherine
  * peptides - transcribed /translated into (usually) a large precursor which is cleaved to give the functional peptide.
* **Axoplasmic transport** - move items through the neuron
  * **anterograde** - movement from cell body to terminal, slow or fast
    * **Slow axoplasmic transport(anterograde)** - uses cytoplasm and moves large cytoskeleton elements along microtubeles at a rate of .5mm/day
    * **Fast axoplasmic transport(anterograde)** - 400mm per day, moves vesicles down microtubule tracts, uses _kinesin_
  * **retrograde** - from terminal to cell body, one speed. Uses motor protein _dynein_
    * **dynein** - hydrolyzes ATP for a conformational change to step along microtubule.
  * microtubeles have a polarity that kinesin and dynein use for going their specific directions.
  * vesicle membrane is tagged with a "shipping label" a olecule that will bind it to either kinesin or dynein
  * somehow neuron can regulate this transport
  * **synaptic integration** - a neuron receives inputs from several different neurons at a time, the interplay of all its inputs determines whether that neuron crosses threshold and fires an AP.
  * **Spike initiation zone** - right at the beginning of axon next to cell body, generally where AP is started, where threshold is lowest since it has a high conc of Na+ v-gated  channel
  * PSP out on a dendrite spreads passively through terminal.
  * The neuron declines in amplitude dep on space constant (time constant) cable properties.
  * The farther the synapse is from the SIZ, the smaller will be the psp when it reaches the SIZ - also depends on things like Rm, Ri, Cm in the neuron where the synapse is located to the SIZ
  * for lambda (space constant), a high Rm and a low Ri would help spread PSP with less decline in amplitude to the SIZ.
  * for tau, a long time constant means the AP would last longer, and would be more likely to sum/add to other PSP's from various distances
  * At the same time all the epsps are coming to te SIZ, IPSPs are also. All of the PSPs at a given point in time at the SIZ will determine wheter the neuron crosses threshold and fires an AP
  * **Spacial summation** -PSPs whos amplitudes are addected by how far they have traveled (space constant), how they all add up
  * **temporal summation** - how large those PSPs are at a particular time that is determined by the time constant.
* Drugs with presynaptic effects
  * **Cocaine** - presynaptic effects, Blocks dopamine transporter for reuptake
  * **Methanphetamine** - presynaptic effects, causes transporter to "run backward", dumping dopamine from terminal into synaptic cleft -even without it being in vesicles
  * **Ritalin** - presynaptic effects, interferes(blocks) dopamine transporter, perhaps can be used to treat cocaine addiction
  * KO mice missing doplamine transporter, hyperactive like on cocaine but insensitive to cocaine. 100x prolonged presence of doplamine in synapse.
    * **Doplamine** -  is actually not a common transmitter in the brain. Found in 2 pathways: Nigrostantal pathway and Ventral tegmental
      1. **Nigrostantal pathway** - from substantia nigra , for motor control, cells in substantia nigra die in parkinsons
      2. **Ventral tegmental**- area to nucleus accumbens - the pleasure circuit. Relevant for drug abuse
  * **Seratonin transporter in presynaptic terminal** - antidepressents may interfere with transporter, leaving Seratonin in synapse longer. Zoloft, Paxtil, Prozac
  * **Ecstasy** - presynaptic effects, MDMA Feels best first time around, next day pain threshold is lower. Causes seratonin transporter to work backwards, causes 80% of brain seratonin to be dumped
    * runs backwards - instead of transporter picking up into cell and removing, dumps into synapse.
* Drugs with postsynaptic effects
  * **Nicotine** - postsynaptic effects, binds ACh receptors in ventral tegmented cells (which are dopaminergic), stimulating the to release more dopamine into the nucleus accumbens.
    * ACh is released from a presynaptic cell to the ventral tegmented cell, Nicotine acts on the ACh receptor in the ventral tegmental cell to stimulate it (but its postsynaptic to the source of ACh)
    * When ventral tegmenteal cell is stimulated it releases more dopamine into the synapse at the nucleus accumbens.
  * **Opiates** - postsynaptic effects, bind at pre existing endorphin receptors on certain cells. Pain relief in spinal cord where binds at receptors on cells receiving input from pain receptors. Tones down response. Its a G-Protein mediated system. Geroin crosses BBB more easily than morphine so its more effective.
    * But for addiction/pleasure path, block receptors on the dopaminergic cells of ventral tegmental areathat are receptors for GABA and normally act to supress activity of the cells.
    * Opiates inhibit this inhibition - So these cells are more active and release more dopamine in the nucleus accumbens.
  * **Marajuana** - Active ingredient THC, binds a receptor already there. THC type receptors are in peripheral tissues - have been clones but in brain has not yet
  * **Alcohol** - Nonspecific, passes through BBB easily. Seems to block GABA-ergic input  to doplamine cells in ventral tegmental area, but also goes everywhere else.
      * inhibits v-gated Ca++ channels to inhibit n.t. release, reduces activation of cAMP
      * GABA-enhancing drugs, are tranquiizers
  * **Psychadelic drugs** - Postsynaptic effects, structurally similar to serotinin, especially som to doplamine. Bind to serotonin type 2A receptors to stimulate or interfere with them. Include LSD, psilocybin, mescaline, bufoterine.
    * 1943 Hoffman - Synthesized and applied LSD to rats, saw no effect so took it himself and described effects. Got psilocybin from certain mushrooms, no effects from rats so he tried it himself.
    * 1950's - tried to make truth serum
    * 1960's - timothy leary gave LSD and other hallucionogenic drugs bad rep, research basically stopped.
    * Shows promise for PTSD and depression -
  * **Ethnobotany** - Wade Davis (student) collected 'zombie powder', one sample had TTX.
  * **Clavius Narcisse** - (?)
  * **Facilitation** - synaptic strength increases when the synapse is stimulated several times in quick succession.
    * Presyn cell - stimulus looks like ---|-----|-|-|-|------|---- (burst)
    * Postsyn cell PSP's- response (increasing amplitude with each ap of the burst)
    * **Homosynaptic facilitation** - one synapse, see affect on postsynaptic cell. presynaptic terminal has the effect of: the Ca++ that enters each time the presunaptic cell is stimulated lingers in the presynaptic terminal, so if another stimulus arrives before the Ca++ is cleared from the terminal, that Ca++ adds to the new influx of Ca++ from the next stimulus, there is more Ca++ in the terminal so more vesicles are released. This leads to a larger psp in the postsynaptic cell. Not all presynaptic terminals do this.
    (IMG)
    * **Heterosynaptic facilitation** - uses 3 neurons, 2 synapses. Synapse between test and recorded cell has some effect when test fires Test cell synapses with record cell, priming cell synapses with test's cell terminal. When priming is activated, releases neuromodulator that asserts effect on test cell. and when test cell is stimulated again, its release of nt is altered.
      * neuromodulater could make channels easier or harder to open, NA+ or K+ or Ca++
    * These all affect the strength of the synapse between the test cell and the recorded cell
    * there can be heterosynapctic and homosynaptic facilitation and depression, depending on the effect
      * stronger response - facilitation
      * depression - weaker response in recorded neuron
    * **Posttetonic potentiation** - at single synapse. Ca++ enters during the AP in presynaptic terminal. When presynaptic cell shows a burst of activity, there is some buildup of Ca++ in the terminal, so some  inc in nt release and amplitude of postsynaptic cell Ca++ gets sequestered into mitochondria and ER. But then over the next 10 min or so the Ca++ leaks out of the organelles and so builds up in the terminal over several min so that if the presynaptic cell is stimulated after this, theres lots of Ca++ and lots of nt that is released. Not all synapses do this!
    (img)
      * pre : -|------|||||---------|---
        * First AP, then synapse burst of AP, then wait 10 min, then one AP
      * post : -(small)----(increasing amplitute psp's) --------- (large PSP)
* **Long Term Potentiation** - Most studied in hippocampus, forming memories. NT is glutamate. # glutamate receptors
  * **glutamate receptors** - Kainate receptor K receptor, AMPA receptor binds AMPA, NMDA receptor binds NMDA. All bind glutamate.
    * All of these channels open to allow the passage of 2 ions K and Na to pass through.
    * **NMDA receptor** - Type of glutamate receptor, requires glutamate in presynaptic and depolarization in postsynaptic to open. When it is open, allows passage of Na+,K+,Ca++. Post channel is normally plugged with Mg++ inside of it, blocks Na,K,Ca even with glutamate, depol releases Mg. Used in LTP.
      * why does NMDa receptor need the postsyn cell (where it lives) to be strongly depolarized? BC channel is normally plugged with Mg++ inside of it, blocks Na,K,Ca even with glutamate. Remove Mg with depolarization to repulse Mg.
      * When this happens, [Ca++]inside increases and activates NO synthase which makes NO gas.
      * NO gas diffuses out of postsynaptic cell where it can activate a biochemical cascade leading to enhanced release of glutamate.
      * **In the postsynaptic cell of NMDA** - the inc [Ca++]in can activate biochemical cascades leading to increased sensitivity to glutamate by K and AMPA receptors by making more K and AMPA receptors and adding them to the postsynaptic membrane. Also, [Ca++]inside increases and activates NO synthase which makes NO gas. NO gas diffuses out of postsynaptic cell where it can activate a biochemical cascade leading to enhanced release of glutamate.
    * all lead to strengthening the synapse
* **Molecular basis of learning**
  * **Sensitization** - sea slug has a head, siphon, gill, tail. Gentle touching siphon will not cause gill retraction, shocking will. Can pair touch of siphon with retraction using shocks to tail.
  * (Neural circuit simplified img) - siphon sens neuron and tail sens neuron both synapse w/ motor neuron to withdraw gill. Facilitating interneuron takes input from tail and synapses with motor neuron and sensory neuron.
  * Synapse that is strengthened is the siphon sensory neuron synapse with the gill motorneuron.
  1. **Touch siphon** - the terminal depolarizes, Ca++ enters glutamate is released onto the motor neuron that withdraws the gill. But its not enough of an epsp in the motor neuron to cause it an AP. Small inc in cAMP
    * but Ca++ also causes activation of calmodulin which activates adenylyl cyclase which stimulates production of cAMP.
  2. **Shock the tail** - tail sensory neuron synapses with the siphon sensory neuron terminal by way of the facilitating interneurons. Causes facilitating interneuron to release seratonin onto the siphon sens neuron. Small inc in cAMP. Seratonin binds g-protein coupled receptor. Activated adenylyl cyclase which activates production of cAMP.
  3. **Pair stimulation by touching siphon with stimulating siphon sens neuron by way of facilitating interneuron** - Get a bigger increase in cAMP by these 2 mechanisms
    1. Ca++ entry due to siphon neuron -> calmodulin -> adenylyl cyclase -> small cAMP
    2. Seratonin from facilitating interneuron activates G-protein -> adenylyl cyclase -> small cAMP
  4. **This large increase in cAMP leads to** - protein kinase A, pkA
    * **pkA** - phosphorylates a K+ channel, causing it to close so AP in the terminal lasts longer, more Ca++ comes in and more transmitter(glutamate) is released by the sipon sensory neuron onto the gill motorneuron.
      * bigger epsp, more likely to generate an AP.
  5. **The seratonin from facilitating internuron also binds to another g-protein associated receptor that activates** - DAG
    * **Dag activates** - protein kinase C
    * **pkC phosphorylates** - synapsin 1 causing it to release glutamate vesicles attached to cytoskeleton into the storage pool.
  6. **If training continues and pkA levels stay high enough long enough** - pkA can migrate up and into the nucleous and phosphorylate CREB1, which activates transcription factors, and Activates MAPK which deactivates CREB2( a transcription repressor ).
    * pkA phosphorylates CREB1
    * CREB1 joins cAMP to bind DNA, Activate transcription factor(s)
    * which promote transcription of genes
      1. for enhancing transmitter release.
      2.  prehaps making more synapses
  7. pkA can phosphotylate MAPK in cell body  
    * MAPK represses the activity of a transcription repressor called CREB2
  8. There is LTP between the sensory neuron and gill motorneurons
    * glutamate is released from siphon sensory neuron  
      1. Bind to K and AMPA receptors
      2. There are also NMDA receptors
    * the gill motor neuron receivs glutamate from siphon sensory neuron
      1. and a strong depolarization from the facilitating interneuron when tail is shocked along with siphon touched
      2. this expells the Mg++ from the NMDA channel and LTP can occur as Ca++ enters
        * activating protein kinases which
          1. increase sensitivity of AMPA channels
          2. produce NO gas by activating NO synthase
      3. NO gas diffuses across synapse to siphon sensory neuron
        * to cause it to enhance glutamate release
        (IMG - draw it out)
* Other animals
  * Drosophila has been used because of the option to generate mutations at different key points along the learning pathway.
  * associate odors with  
    * sugar (bad!)
    * sugar solution (good!)
  * isolated mutants
    * **dunce** - lacks phosphodiesterase (breaks down cAMP) always had elevated cAMP levels. too high cAMP prevents elevation in cAMP impossible, therefore learning was difficult.
    * **rutabaga** - mutant is deficent in adenylyl cyclase, cannot inc cAMP. Not enough to strengthen synapses.
  * Humans: **Huntington's** - mutant protein interferes with CREB1 activation
    * other known deficiencies in CREB in humans which also show learning problems

### The Eye
  * Goal 1: to form a sharp image onto the retina where the sensory cells detect it.
    * Amount of light brought to the retina can be adjusted by adjusting pupil diameter
    * Making a sharp image uses cornea but especially lens, lens changes shape to accomodate focus on close objects.
      * **ciliary muscle** - relaxed is streched lens, focuses in distance due to flat lens. Up close, ciliary muscles clench, lens is rounder.
    * To form a sharp image, the sensory neurons you have that receive the image, the sharper the image will be, higher the activity
    * Eyes ae moved so that when you look at something, image is placed onto a part of retina with an especially high concentration of receptors - the fovea
  * The retina has 5 kinds of cells
    * **Receptor cells** - rod and cones
    * **horizontal cells** - cross-connect retinal cells
    * **bipolar cell** - receives input from receptor cells
    * **ganglion cells** - have axons that go to the lateral geneulate, make up the optic nerve
    * **amarine cells** - which modulate signals from bipolar cells and ganglion cells.
  * Because the **retina is set up as** - rods and cones in back of retina, preceded by bipolar, then ganglion cells on top closest to light
      * ganglion cell axons make up the optic nerve, this creates a _blind spot_.
  * Detecting light - done by rods and cones
    * Done by rods and cones which transduce a physical property light) into a neural signal. These are called photoreceptors
    * On the outer segment which has Rod cells and cone cells:
    ![](/Images/rc.jpg/)
      * membrane disks (in rod) or folds of cell membrane(cone) inc surface area
    * outer segment membrane contains photopigment(s)
    * photopigment is different in rods and cones, it includes molecule of _11-cis-retinal_ surrounded by opsins
    * in **rods photopigment** - opsin = rodopsin. more sensitive to low light
    * in **cones photopigment** - opsins absorb different wavelengths, ability to absorb different colors. not very sensitive to low light levels.
    * cone opsins can discriminate different colors but are not very sensitive to low light levels
    * red opsin is more sensitive to low light
    * **11-cis-retinal** - excited by photons from opsin that traps light . Photon causes a rapid conformational change which = "photoexcited", activates a G-protein transducin.
    * **transducin** - G-protein  in eye activated by 11-cis-retinal. Activates phosphodiestrase.
    * **phosphodiesterase** - breaks down cGMP and turns it into 5'GMP, which causes ion channels to close.
    * **cGMP** - Bound to ion(Na+) channel to hold it open. when cGMP decreases, channels will close, cell will hyperpolarize.
    * **Light will do what to cGMP?** - break down cGMP, closing Na+ channels.
    * **Dark will do what to cGMP?** - Lots of cGMP, opening Na+ channels.
    * the breakdown of cGMP causes ion channels to close.
      * why? cGMP when present is bound to ion channel to hold it open. when cGMP decreases, channels will close, leads to change in Vm for the photoreceptor.
      * This channel is a Na+ channel
      * Light closes Na+ channels - causing cell to hyperpolarize
      * the membrane of the inner segment of the photoreceptor is packed with K+ channels so when there is no light in the dark, Na+ channels are open plenty of cGMP to hold them open. Na+ enters, and to maintain Vm, K+ exits the inner segment dark. Creates a current from top Na+ in and bottom + out, known as the _dark current_.
      * **Dark current** - in the dark,  Na+ channels are open (plenty of cGMP). To maintain Vm, K+ exits the inner segment dark. Creates a current from top to bottom.
    * **When light reaches the outer segment of eye** - Na+ channels close but K+ channels remain open in the inner segment so photoreceptor Vm dips torward Ek, it hyperpolarizes.
        * amount it hyperpolarizes depends on how many Na+ channels close in other words how bright is the light.
        * The response of the photoreceptor is graded with the intensity of the light.
        * bright light will close all Na+ receptors, brightest you can see
        * test, do practice problem from disc
        * photoreceptors can adjust their operating range to different light levels.
        * **Adapation to different levels of light** - need some Na+ channel open and some closed in order for a photoreceptor to register a change in Vm
        * **Enter a dark room** - Na+ channels open, plenty of cGMP around now, Ca++ flows through Na+ channels, Ca++ interferes with cGMP synthesis, Ca++ decreases cGMP levels, come channels close.
          * Na+ channels all open up - plenty of cGMP around now, you cant see
          * Now: Na+ channels are permiable to Na+ _and Ca++_.
          * Ca++ in photoreceptors interferes with cGMP synthesis.
          * When you are in a dark room, Ca++ that enters throuhg the Na+ channel decreases cGMP levels, so less cGMP is around to hold Na+ channels open.
          * And you are back to a situation where some Na+ channels are open, some closed, and you see again.
        * Opposite happens when you enter a bright light.
        * Bipolar cells receive synapses from photoreceptors. **Photoreceptors** -  release neurotransmitter onto bipolar cells. when they hyperpolarize(hit by light), they turn down their n.t. release. This is graded. No AP needed in photoreceptor to release nt.
        * **OFF: Bipolar cell** - glutamate is an excitatory. bp cell is always, depolarized because of the steady supply of excitatory nt. Light hits the photoreceptor, it releases less of the excitatory nt, bipolar cell will hyperpolarize
          * in the Unstimulated photoreceptor, there is always some glutamate being released.
          * this bipolar cellis always a little depolarized because of the steady supply of excitatory nt
          * when light hits the photoreceptor, it releases less of the excitatory nt
          * and so the bipolar cell will hyperpolarize
        * **ON:BP cell** - Glutamate is inhibitory. When photoreceptors hyperpolarize due to light, inhibition is shut off and bipolar cell depolarizes.
        * **Bipolar cells** have receptive fields:
          * **Receptive field** - the area of the world where an image affects the bipolar cell's output
            * Receptive field in a touch receptor
            ![receptive field](/Images/rf.jpg)
            * In a neuron that receives inputs from several touches:
              * multiple touch receptors interface with single neuron, that neuron gets inputs from all of them.
            * the receptive field of a bipolar cell is a circle
              * _center_ and _surrounding_ have 2 separate receptive fields, opposite. Its response to photoreceptors that detect images in the center of its receptive field will always be the opposite  to a stimulus that acts on a photoreceptor that is providing info on the surround.
              * if bipolar cell has an "on" response to stimuli in the center of its receptive field, it will have an off response to stimuli in the surround and vice-versa.
              * bipolar cells can be on center, off surround or off center, on surround.
              * **Sign conserving synapse** - if bipolar cell responds to its presynaptic photoreceptor cell with the same type of response as what the photoreceptor did ( photoreceptor and bipolar cell both hyperpolarize)
              * **Sign inverting synapse** - if the bipolar cells response is the opposite to that of the presynaptic.
            * **Center** - comes from photoreceptors that are directly presynaptic to it. When photoreceptor is stimulated with light, it gives info on the center. Center can have more stimulation(more area is stimulated) or less, this determines how strong the bipolar cells response will be.
            Center leaks glutamate(inhibitory) always in the dark, when light hits it is inhibited, bipolar depolarizes because it isnt inhibited anymore.
            * **Surround** - gets input from other photoreceptors that interact with the bipolar cell by way of a horizontal cell. Surround response is always the opposite of the center response. Inhibits the photoreceptor on center with GABA. When surronding photoreceptor is depolarizes from light, depolarizes horizontal cell which shuts it off. Sign inverting synapse between horz and center photoreceptor.
              * Surround is opposite, input comes from photoreceptor and sends it to horizontal cell, HC synapses with Synapse of photoreceptor and bipolar cell in the center
              * The **horizontal cell** - releases GABA onto the synapse to the bipolar, which is inhibitory. When photoreceptor is stimulated, sign conserving signal shuts off horizontal cell which shuts off inhibition.
              * In the dark(when the surround is not stimulated), horizontal cell is always releasing GABA onto center photoreceptor. Always a little bit of inhibition.
              * When horizontal cell receives hyperolarization by stimulating the surround photoreceptor, it shuts of this inhibition
                * This allows the photoreceptor to depolarize (usually hyperpolarized when light hits it).
              * if **light falls on center** -  hyperpolarizes
              * if **light falls on surround**- depolarizes
              (IMG from phone and ppt)
              * All of this is _graded_ - if a little of the center of the bipolar cell's receptive field is stimulated
              * **When both center and surround is stimulated** - Big deploarization and big hyperpolarization add -> no signal
            * EXAMPLE.
              * Suppose on center bipolar cell, stimulate center only. Center depolarizes because presynaptic photoreceptor, stimulated by light, hyperpolarizes and releases _less glutamate_ onto the bipolar cell.
                * That bipolar cell has a receptor that uses glutamate as inhibitory. Is now more prone to fire
              * The surround - stimulation will cause bipolar cell to hyperpolarizes
                * here the presynaptic photoreceptor depolarizes and releases _more_ of the glutamate that is for this bipoar cell, inhibitory
                * Horizontal cell shuts off its inhibition
              * Why does the presynaptic photoreceptor depolarize when surround is stimulated by light?
                * because the horizontal cell that synapses with it shuts off the release of inhibitory GABA.
              * Why does a horizonal cell shut off its release of GABA?
                * Because its input from its presynaptic surround photoreceptors hyperpolarize it.
                * as photoreceptors hyperpolarize, horizontal cell does too
          * So: bipolar cells show opposite responses to light falling on center vs surround of receptive field.
        * **Ganglion cell** - Next cells in line, axons make the optic nerve which goes from retina -> Lateral Geniculate
          * ganglion cells must send signal some distance - fire AP
          * Have a center/surround receptive field, which matches in its 'on' or 'off' responses to the bipolar cells presynaptic to it
          * Ganglion cells are always firing some AP an 'on' response is an inc in firing freq.
          * **Ganglion on response** - light causes more AP
          * **Ganglion off response** - light causes less AP

          * 2 types of ganglion cells (in primates):
            * **p Cells** - small receptive fields, high spacial resolution, color sensitive. info from fovea
            * **m Cells** - Large receptive fields, sensitive to contrast, sensitive to movement not color. Not fovea
            * P cells get info from fovea, m cells from other parts of the retina
        * **Amacrine cells** - synapse with bipolar and ganglion cells, contain many different NT including GABA, glycine, ACh, doplamine, peptides. Shape responses of ganglion cells.
