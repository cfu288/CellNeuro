* **Brain and the Lateral Geniculate**
  * projections from retina cross the midline at the optic chiasm
    * (most of) right eye axons to left side of brain in primates, all axons in others
      * important in depth perception
    * axons that receive inputs from the left half of the visual field from each eye will join up together in the right lateral geniculate.
    (IMG)
    * Images from the right half of the vision field will fall on the Lateral side of the left retina and nasal side of right retina and the inputs from the left eye do not cross at the chiasm axons from the right eye do creoss at the chiasm and both meet up in the left lateral geniculate (LGN)
  * Organization of the LGN   
    * retina is mapped out in  a topographic map of the world
    * 6 layers in the LGN, each layer has the topographic map, each map are stacked in perfect register.
      * in other words, if experimentally you stick an electrode through theLGN, go straight through all 6 layers, all the cells you records will respond to the stimuli in the same place of the receptive field. Extra representation of the fovea.
    * Layers 1/2 contain large **magnocellular cells** - They receive synapses from M ganglion cells.
    * Layers 3-6 have smaller cells called **parvocellular cells** - receive input from P cells of retina
      * **layers 1,4,6** - from the contralateral eye
      * **Layers 2,3,5** - from ipsilateral eye
    * M layer cells of layer 1/2 are not color sensitive, are sensitive to contrasts and motion
    * P cells of layers 3-6 are color sensitive, high resolution.  Layers may see same part of the world but sensitive to different colors, 3 and 5 will have differnt color sensitivities for example.
    * Each cell in LGN has a particular piece of information that it can pass on to the next level of processing.
    * But: only 25% of input to LGN is from retina, 75%comes from visual cortex and brainstem. What is it doing?
    * LGN axons travel to visual cortex in occipital lobe.
    * terminate in a specific stop
      * primary visual cortex.
        * Vi
        * area 17
        * striate cortex
      * about 2mm thick, organized into 6 layers
      * LGN axons project to layer 4. Depending on which layer from LGN go to diferent sublayers
        * different sublayers for magnocellular parvocellular
      * Each layer of visual cortex has topographic map, large portion dedicated to fovea
    * Cells of visual cortex
      * **simple cell** - recives LGN inputs, found in layer 4. Have receptive fields with on center or off center, surround responses are opposite to center. Receptive field is in shape of bar. Var has specific orientation that is preferred.
      * input comes from several LGN cells which all have receptive fields that are next to each other so centers line up in a bar - all of the centers ave same on or off response.
      * Simple cell responds with up or down in firing frequency;
      * outputs of simple cells in layer 4 go to layers 2+3 where the **complex cells** - are sensitive to edges w/ particular orientation. Can be anywhere in receptive field.
      * Can be anywhere in receptive field so inputs come from several simple cells that all have the same preferred orientation fir the bar of light
        * some complex cells like edges that move.
      * Organization of primary visual cortex layers.
        * topographic map in each
        * orientation colums - cells in all layers in a vertical column have the same preferred orientation for light bars (or edges)
        * over a min or so, all possible orientations are represented.
      * Ocular dominance columns
        * each eye is represented in alternating bands of cells.
      * Color sensitivity in set of cells, call this collection of color sensitive cells a blob.
      * info from primary visual cortex gets sent to other layers of the cortex for "further processing"
    * Depth perception
      * Need two eyes that have some overlap in receptive fields
      * Look at a point on 3D object points that are art of this object that are in front and behind **fixation point**
      * points that are part of this object that are in front and behind fixation point will fall on slightly different places on the 2 retinas
      * this disparity is sensed by specific cells in the brain binocular disparity cells which interpret the images as part of one structure but in 3d
      * if disparities are too far apart, you will see 2 images
    * **Auditory system**
      * **Sound intensity** - measured in decibels, measured in logs
      * 0db - below what you can hear
      * 20 db - whisper
      * 30 db - 10x louder than 20
      * 40 db - 100x louder than 20
      * Jet engine - 160db
      * rock concert - 119-140
      * **sound frequency** - number of cycles per second (Hz)
        * human hearing: 20 - 20khz
        * sound is propogated through air as compression of air molecules alternating with rarefaction t a particular distance to or wavelength
