___ end of test 2 material (no neuromodulation)___
## Neuromodulation
* Neuromodulation is slower to activate than neurotransmitter activity. It can also last longer.
* **Neuromodular** - indirect transmitter, lignad binds to metabotropic receptor, using g protein activates ion channel to open in
* Direct transmitter - ligand binds to channel to open it
* **G-proteins** - modulator binds to a receptor = metabotropic receptor. Bound receptor becomes activated and activates a G-Protein. Can lead to complex biochemical cascades
* **Metabotrophic receptors structurally** - have 7 transmembrane spanning regions. Have carboxy tail inside, amino terminus outside, binding site outside, bonding site for g-protein inside, phosphorylation sites which when phosphorylated, desensitize the membrane. Some are on carboxyl tail
1. transmitter/modulator binds at its receptor (specific)
2. on the inside, the receptor was bound to a G protein, when the neurotransmitter binds to the receptor, the f protein is activated.
3. G has 3 subinits, a,b,gamma, and bind GDP. sheds GDP, binds to GTP instead. At the same time, the g protein splits and the a subunit seperates from the b and gamma. Active.
4. Subunits, a and bg subunits go on to do things
5. a subunit is a GTPase, GTP -> GDP
6. a-GDP reassembles with bg and reforms the g protein. Also the receptor itself can desensitize and not bind anymore
* **Activated subunits can do many things**
* Muscarinic ACh receptor in the heart is metabotropic
* here the activated g proteins bg subunit binds directly to a K+ channel and conformationally opens channel, brings down membrane potential to slow down heartrate
* Experiment: apply ACh to the outside of a heart muscle membrane - in patch clamp lost of outward current. then find that using an inside out patch clamp apply activated bg subunit _only_ to inside of membrane
* see the same effect as applyinf ACH to outside
* Other metabotrophic systems are more complex
* the activated G protein subunits may activate second messenger biochemical cascades
* 2nd messengers include cAMP, cGMP, NO, Ca++, lipids like DAG, IP3
* may activate adenyl cyclase which makes cAMP and the cAMP can activate things
* for example: Activated Gprotein subunits may activate adente maylyl cyclase which then produces cAMP
* cAMP will activate a protein kinase, protein kinase puts a phosphate on to a protein (phosphorylates the protein) the phosphorylate dprotein could be an ion channel
* To terminate the activity:  
* the phosphate may be removed from the channel by a protein phosphatase
* cAMP can be broken down by _phosphosterase_
* if cAMP is high enough and long enough, can get changes in gene expression (Make more ion channels? or receptors for that molecule)
* Another 2nd messenger system
* in this example the end result is a Ca++ channel is phosphorylated and closed
1. Modulator binds to a receptor on membrane
2. Activated receptor activates a G-Protein
3. Activated G-Protein binds to GTP, splits into alpha-GTP and bg subunits.
Inside the cell membrane is an enzyme, Phospholipase C. Both subunits of G-Protein bind here.

* Variations on this pathway
* PIP2 can open/close channels
* intracellular Ca++ can lead to channels opening/closing or other things
* Why such an complex system?
* amplifies signal
* effect can last a while (seconds or hours)
* if active long enough, can make permanent changes through gene activation
* an activated receptor at one location can effect changes throughout the neuron. Single neuromodulator can create an exponential amount of target proteins
* Final step is to get the modulator off the receptor to inactivate the cascade
* For neuro-transmitter or modulators, enzymes include:
* for ACh => acetylcholine esterase AchE
* for monoamines like Seratonin, Doplamine => monoamine oxidase MAO
* Diffusion away from the postsynaptic cell also negative effect
* Re-uptake mechanisms:
  * presynaptic cell membrane take up transmitter or modulator and returns it to the presynaptic terminal for reuse

## Neurotransmitter release from pre-synaptic terminal
* Chemical synapses have a synaptic delay. (.5 msec)
* temperature sensitive, warmer is faster
* indicates delay involves more than time for diffusion (Diffusion estimated to take.5 msec)
* must take soe time to release the neurotransmitter
* Katz and Miledi 1960's - treat neuromuscular junction with small doses of TTX; find that postsynaptic potentials hae a minimum amplitude. PSPs are multiples of that minimum amplitude
* **minature endplate potential** - Minimum amplitude, aka mini quantal units. Equal to the release of one packet of neurotransmitters (1 vesicle).
* Continuing applying TTX to block all Na channels, then electrically(artificially using electrodes) stimulate presynaptic cell, still see PSPs in muscle.
* Can use TTX and TEA, still get transmitter release when electrically stimulate
* So : Na+ or K+ not needed, although depolarization is needed
* But: if Ca++ is removed from extracellular bath, no transmitter is released.
* Normally, a.p. in presynaptic cell reaches the terminal. The depolarization causes
* voltage gated Ca++ channels to open
* Ca++ enters to the point that [Ca++]in terminal can increase 200x
