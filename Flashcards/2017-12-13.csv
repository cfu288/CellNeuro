p Cells|small receptive fields, high spacial resolution, color sensitive. info from fovea
m Cells|Large receptive fields, sensitive to contrast, sensitive to movement not color. Not fovea
Axons that receive inputs from the left half of the visual field from each eye|will join up together in the right lateral geniculate.
Images from the right half of the vision field will fall on|the Lateral side of the left retina and nasal side of right retina and the inputs from the left eye do not cross at the chiasm axons from the right eye do creoss at the chiasm and both meet up in the left lateral geniculate (LGN)
Organization of the LGN|6 layers in the LGN, each layer has the topographic map, each map are stacked in perfect register.
magnocellular cells|Large cells, they receive synapses from M ganglion cells. Found in Layers 1/2
parvocellular cells|Small cells, receive input from P cells of retina. Found in layers 3-6.
layers 1,4,6|from the contralateral eye, opposite to that on which a particular structure or condition occurs.
Layers 2,3,5|from ipsilateral eye, belonging to or occurring on the same side of the body.
M layer cells of layer 1/2|are not color sensitive, are sensitive to contrasts and motion
P cells of layers 3-6|are color sensitive, high resolution.  Layers may see same part of the world but sensitive to different colors, 3 and 5 will have different color sensitivities for example.
only 25% of input to LGN|is from retina, 75% comes from visual cortex and brainstem. What is it doing?
primary visual cortex|V1, area 17, striate cortex. about 2mm thick, organized into 6 layers. Each layer of visual cortex has topographic map, large portion dedicated to fovea
simple cell|recives LGN inputs, found in layer 4. Have receptive fields with on center or off center, surround responses are opposite to center. Receptive field is in shape of bar. Var has specific orientation that is preferred.
complex cells|are sensitive to edges w/ particular orientation. Can be anywhere in receptive field.
Ocular dominance columns|each eye is represented in alternating bands of cells.
Depth perception|Need two eyes that have some overlap in receptive fields. Look at a point on 3D object points that are part of this object that are in front and behind **fixation point**. This disparity is sensed by specific cells in the brain binocular disparity cells which interpret the images as part of one structure but in 3d
Sound intensity|measured in decibels, measured in logs
sound frequency|number of cycles per second (Hz)
Outer ear|pinna - shape for localizing sound
Middle ear|Eardrum + ossicles. ossicles = 3 bones, incus, malleus, stapes. Sound hit eardrum which moves ossicles, stapes pushes inner ear
Inner ear|cochlea - coiled tube 35mm long
scala vestibuli|upper part in cochlea
scala tympani|lower part in cochlea
partition in cochlear membrane supports|**basilar membrane**  under hair cells and **tectorial membrane** above
basil end has 2 membrane covered holes|oval window - stapes attaches, and round window
Cochlea near the apical end|Partition does not go all the way to the end, called **heliocotrema**, so s.vestibuli and tympani are not sealed from each other.
basilar membrane|sitting here are the sensory neurons = hair cells
hair cells|have cilia on the top of the cell, looked like someone snipped the hairs at an angle. hair cells do not fire ap. Do not have axons. Synapse with auditory neurons signals are graded changes in Vm.
kinocillium|longest hair cell and the others are called stereocillia. No axons.
inner hair cells|what detect sound. 95% of sensory neurons for our ear are these.
outer hair cells|more of them. 75% of total hair population. receive input from brain.
high freq motion in the cochlea|causes the basilar membrane to move most at basal end.
Low freq|move more at apical end
Mechanical tuning|in cochlea, short and stiff respond better to high freq, long flexible to low freq. Also: hairs are constructed to be shorter and stiffer at basal end of cochlea, longer more flexible at apical end
tiplinks|connected to ion channels which are on the tip of the hair. When stereocilia move toward kinocilium, they stretch the tip links and open ion channels, hair cell depolarizes. When stereocilia move opposite direction, (away from kino), tiplinks relax, ion channels close, hair cell hyperpolarizes.
When basilar membrane moves up|during rarefaction phase of sound 'wave' the stereocilia move toward the kinocilium and the hair cell depolarizes.
when the basilar membrane moves down|during compression of the sound 'wave', stereocilia move away from the kinocilium, ion channel closes, hair cell hyperpolarizes
as K+ enters hair top|hair depol, activates v-Ca++ channels which open. Ca++ enters, hair cell releases n.t.
After K+ enters hair top, on basal end of hair cells|this inc [Ca++]in opens Ca++ activated K+ channels. here, K+ exits the cell. This brings Vm back to starting value and then as motion of hair cell moves below starting position, more K+ channels on the hair tips are closed than at rest so Vm hyperpolarizes due to K+ exiting the basal portion of the cell.
Electrical tuning|The Ca++ activated K+ channels (also called big K channels or bK) when they open, K+ exits, Vm drops
for high freq hair cells (electrial tuning)|gK+ for bK channel is high so K+ exits quickly and Vm can change quiclky.
For low freq hairs (electrical tuning)|gK+ for bK channels is much lower and Vm changes more slowly
Active tuning|basilar membrane motion can be tuned down at a particular frequency. This happens if there is a sound that is particularly loud at that frequency. Outer hair cells use prestin motor protein that shortens when Vm+. pulls basilar membrane further up
prestin|charged protein that reacts to changes in membrane potential. When Vm becomes (+), prestin shortens. When Vm, becomes -, it lengthens, when it becomes -, it relaxes.
Damage to outer hair cells|leads to trouble discriminating sounds. Can still hear you, but its hard to make out what you're saying.
Outer hair cells receive inputs|from superior olive of brain. inhibitory Ach inhibitory
auditory neurons|are tuned to frequency by which hair cells they receive input from, fire a.p. when big stimulus, means lots of spikes. A lesser stimulus or one of freqencies from other hair cells that they do not receive input from, dont fire.
Tuning curve|describes auditory neuron's response on graph. Plot threshold on X, freq on y. Minimum response to generate a response as function of frequency of sound.
Sharp curve|narrowly tuned
Broad curve|Broadly tuned
Frequency coding|by auditory neurons - low freq (100hz or less) auditory neurons will fire AP at same freq as the hair cells release nt. But as freq inc, AP cannot fire fast enough. Instead, fire at the same phase as sound stimulus - can encode frequency higher than AP rate.
phase-locked|Auditory neurons always fire at the same phase of a cycle (fire in the same point in the cycle, generally at the peak). We can use this mechanism up to 4khz
Above 4khz|is encoded by the identity of the auditory neuron - which hair cell it gets inputs from auditory neurons ->  Dorsal cochlear nuclei + ventral cochlear nuclei
Direction of the sound stimulus higher freq w/o phase lock (>4khz)|attenuate going from one side of head to other, freq stays the same. In the *superior olive*, neurons have an identity. Right identity epsp from right, ipsp from left.
Sound Shadowing|sound amplitude declines as it passes through your head.
Direction of the sound stimulus for low frequency sounds|where auditory neurons can phase lock, you can use time of arrival of the 2 ears to determine direction. Ears must be far apart for this, done in superior olive of medulla.
Delay line|Again neurons have identities - "sound from right", "left", or "center",etc. When neuron fires, we know sound came from particular direction.
Delays being important are|1. how long sound takes to travel from one side to the other. 2. how long AP take to travel from one side to the other.
Hearing loss|losing hair cells - can they be induced to regenerate? research going on - birds can do it.
Cochelar implants|bypass hair cells entirely, use tonotopic organization of auditory neurons. Wires end at particular frequencies - shorter wire does higher freq.
Each muscle fiber is innervated by|1 motor neuron
Each motor neuron can innervate|>1 muscle fiber.
Motor unit|motor neuron + all fibers it innervates. Activating more motor units will increase the strength of a contraction.
Alpha motor neurons|muscles mostly innervated by these in the legs.
la afferent|Sensory receptor for stretch's axon tocrus .
Each motor neuron receives input|from several la afferents and each la afferents has inputs to several alpha mns.
Each single epsps from a la afferent|is sub-threshold, but can bring a mn to threshold if la afferent fires a burst of spikes and epsps sum temporally and/or several la afferents are activated and epsps sum by both spacial and temporal summation.
Strength of a muscle's contraction can be increased by|increasing amt of contraction by mn firing more ap on to muscle fibers and/or increasing the number of motor units in the muscle that are activated
motorneurons can e different sizes|small mn only activate a few fibers,  large mn innervate many fibers
suppose you want to lift an item|activate a few small mns, get a small contraction. Could do job but if not, bring in more mn units, brings in large mn which cause more fibers to contract. A graded strength to the contraction.
why does the small motorneurons get activated first?|being small, the la afferent synapses are closer to the SIZ so epsps are larger when they reach that place (length constant is effectively larger), its easier for an epsps generated by input from a la afferent to reach threshold in a small mn than a large mn. Less distance for it to travel.
for a small contraction|the absolute amount of tension increase will be less than for an already large contraction with addition motor units activated.
sensory neuron in la afferents|gets stretched and stimulated. Surrounded by non-contractile capsule. Has muscle fibers on each end of it (intrafusal fibers). Muscle fibers outside this are extrafusal fibers.
as the extrafusal fibers contract|intrafusal do too, restoring tension on the sensor so it can be active if another stretch comes along  at the new shorter muscle length.
synergistic muscles|have the same action
antagonisitic muscles|have opposite action.
Motor patterns|Activity pattern of motor neuron (flight in insects)
Central pattern generator|pattern can occur without any sensory information. Neural circuitry that produces alternating activity among motorneurons without sensory feedback. Brain synapses with 2 interneurons, each which synapse with motor neuron(one which elevates, one depresses). Interneurons inhibit each other
postinhibitory rebound|neuron is hyperpolarized for a while and hyperpolarization is flipped off suddenly, it will fire a burst of action potentials because hyperpolarization allowed more Na+ channels to close and get past the refractory period so more are ready to opem when Vm becomes more positive. Effectively, decreases threshold.
Carnorhabditis elegans|C. elegans - entire lineage of all its neurons has been tracked, know exactly what neuron developed from which original cell. But in most cases, cells develop based on combination of lineage, signals the cells were exposed to during development.

notochord induces|ectodermal cells above it to form nervous system, to change shape to flatten makes neural plate, then groove, then neural folds. Folds get taller and taller until the meet at top and form neural tube. Neural crest cells appear along side the neural tube.
notochord formation|ectodermal cells=> neural plate => groove => folds => tube and crest
ectoderm can become|epidirmis or neural tube if exposed to notochord
epidermis is triggered to form when ectodermal cells are exposed to|BMP4

Retnoic Acid|triggers posterior neural tube development. Activates homeobox genes for posterior cell identity.
sensory more dorsal, interneurons in the ?, motor neurons more ?|dorsal, middle ,ventral
Notochord|is below neural tube, secretes sonic hedgehog (shh) which interacts with cells on ventral neural tube and induces them to become floor plate cells
Ventral Floor plate cells|secrete shh, this + notochord ssh release leads to high concentration of shh in ventral neural tube
Dorsal neural tube cells|is exposed to BMP4. High concentration dorsal side of BMP4
High BMP4|sensory neurons
even BMP and SHH|interneurons
High SHH (floor plate cells)|motor neurons
during neural tube differentation, cells are dividing at a high rate up to|250,000 cells every minute!
cells divide in center, newly formed neurons|climb out onto outer layer of neural tube (so tube gets thicker by adding layers to the outside) using radial glial cells which make a scaffold the neuron attaches to.
neural crest cells|are born alongside neural tube (dorsally) and migrate to far-flung regions of the embryo following chemicals cues in the extracellular matrix. Some attract, some repel, some cause cells that pass over them to follow a particular developmental path to become a particular cell type
neural crest cells can differentiate into sensory neurons if exposed to|leukocyte inducing factor

neural crest cells can also differentiate into|other things including dentin in teeth.
Neurons grow into tectum until|they reach limits of their tolerance to ephrin. Then they stop growing, make a synapse.
extension of axon|growth cone extend highly active, mobile filopodia(uses actin and Ca++)
filopodia are filled|with actin - use myosin and Ca++ to move, probe the enviorment looking for chemical cues
Intergrins|laminin, fibronectin, tenascin. On growth cone and on extracellular matrix. If they share an intergrin these bing and "tack" axon down in that place.

Netrins|can attract or repel from a distance
Semaphorins|when encounter a growth cone - interact with the placement of actin in the filopodia
collapsin|dismantles actin so causes growth cone to turn away from its source.

1st axon to find its way|Pioneer Axon, later developing axons follow the pioneer  
guide post cells|if destroyed, axons get "lost" forming tangles and random paths
growing axons may make transient|(temporary synapses with guide post cells)
Retzius cells in developing hippocampus|ingrowing axons find them and make synapses, cells die after job is done.
Developing Visual cortex|LGN axons make temporary synapses w/ subplate cells until simple cells are born.
if subplate cells are ablated|LGN axons will grow past this and gel lost. In cortex - make tangles, random directions.
Nerve growth factor NGF|molecule that promotes both direction for axon and survival of the neuron.
Sympathetic neuron|born in sympathetic ganglia, have to grow out and find their targets. antibodies to NGF in developing mice. Very few symp neurons in ganglia
