Transverse/Horizontal|cut on plane parallel to ground while standing, split into top half and bottom half. Used in midbrain and spinal
Lymic system|Amygdala, Hippocampus, Nucleus accumbens
Mesencephalon|Midbrain. Relay station for visual (superior colliculus), auditory (inferior colliculus), nuclei.
Superior colliculus|visual relay station in midbrain
Inferior colliculus|auditory relay station in midbrain
Red nucleous|relay station between cerebellum and fuebrain
Subdtantia nigra|postural and motor control nuclei, where cells die in parkinson's disease
Hindbrain|2 devisions, Metencephalon and Myelencephalon
Metencephalon|Pons and cerebellum
Pons|Major fiber tract. Pathway to and from cerebellum and hindbrain. Has some nuclei which control respiration and sleep.
Cerebellum|Maintain muscle tone and balance. Helps in planning out movement smoothly. Motor memory.
Motor error|signals indicate incorrect motion compared to intended motion in cerebellum, correction is then made
Pontire nucleous|receive info about _intended_ movement. Extend out into mossy fibers which synapse with granule cells. Granule cells send up its own axon that synapse the _Purkinje cells_ using parallel fibers.
Inferior olive of Myelencephalon|Gets input about _actual_ movements, synapse with _Purkinje cells_ using climbing fibers, wrap dendrites.
Deep cerebellum nuclei|gets info from _Purkinje cells_ about actual and intended movements; output corrected movement is sent to motor cortex if needed.
Myelencephalon|_Medulla oblongata_, continuation of spinal cord. Blood rate, breathing, coughing, gagging. Controls basic functions, required for survival.
