Patellar Stretch Reflex|Maintains specific tension and length of quadriceps muscle
Ganglion|structure containing a number of nerve cell bodies, physical expansion of spinal chord, connects processes out to muscles.
Dorsal root ganglion|contains the cell bodies of sensory neurons that bring information from the periphery to the spinal cord. Used in stretch reflex
Ganglion/nucleous|A collection of nerve cell bodies
Process|(neurite) extends from ganglion to muscle (term used instead of axon/dendrite)
Sensory Neuron|Detects signals from environment, sends a process to the CNS into the inner gray matter
Pre-Synaptic|Sensory neuron endings, releases neurotransmitters
Post-Synaptic|Motor neuron, receives neurotransmitters
Motor neuron|exists in gray matter of spinal chord, sends signals to muscle via process from CNS
Synaptic cleft|gap, interacts with receptors on post-synaptic cell
Nerre|Collection of processes, bundle of sensory and motor fibers
Afferent|incoming signal to CNS - *dorsal root*
Efferent|outgoing signal from CNS - *ventral root*
Sensory neuron|synapses with motor neuron are on the motor neuron's *dendrites*
Motor neuron|extends an *axon* out to the muscle
Shapes of neurons|reflect who they're connected to (long processes for motor neurons can be 3ft long), where they receive inputs and where they send them
Anaxonal neuron|Difficult to distinguish between inputs and outputs, no obvious axon
Monopolar|(unipolar) only one process extends from body
Bipolar|Branch goes up one way and down another
Multipolar neuron|classic neuron, cell body with dendrites on body and single axon
Interneurons|process signals between sensory and motor neurons
Neuroglia cells|2-3 times as many than neurons. 5 kinds
Astrogilia|look like stars, common. Provide physical support and nutrients for neurons. Regulate k+ conc outside nervous system. Remove excess neurotransmitters from extracellular space.
Radialgilia|Around throughout life of org, important in development. Provide scaffold for migration of neurons.
Microgilia|immune response. made in bone marrow, highly mobile. clean up cellular debris, see a lot near infections or neurodegenerative diseases (Parkison's, Huntington's, Alzheimer's). Excessive activity during development may remove too many synapses leading to issues like possibly autism??
Oligodenetroglia|found in CNS (brain, spinal cord) only, generate _myelin_ (flattened cell membrane w/o plasma) from glial cell. Electrical insulator, allows action potentials to move quicker and more reliably. Each _oligodentrocyte_ myelinates several axons. Block axon regrowth on damage.
Nodes of Ranvier|nodes where AP are generated, gaps in myelin.
Schwann cells|glial cells outside the CNS, in the PNS. Provide myelin. Myelantes only _one_ axon. Takes own cell body and wraps around, squeezing out most cytoplasm. Help regenerate nerve damage.
Nerve net|Networks of interconnected neurons, can have activity that spreads throughout the net. Found in Hydras.
Enteric Nervous System|network of neurons and ganglia on the gut
Dorsal|Back or top of animal
Ventral|Belly or bottom of animal
Anterior|Front, head
Posterior|Back, legs
Rostral|Toward the nose
Coudral|Toward the tail
Lateral|to the outside
Medial|Toward the midline
Proximal|used in reference to another object, closer object to intended object you are referring to
Distal|used in reference to another object, further object to intended object you are referring to
Superior|above (in brain)
Inferior|below (in brain)
Coronal|sliced like a sausage, front and back of brain
Saggital|split down midline, corpus callusom, so you get two mirror image halves
Transverse/Horizontal|cut on plane parallel to ground while standing, split into top half and bottom half
Telencephalon|Higher mental functions. Processes sensory info and motor control. Two cerebral hemispheres connected by corpus callosum. Contains 4 lobes of the brain determined by brain folds
Gyrus|mountain fold of brain
Sulcus|Valley fold of brain
Corpus callosum|big myelinated bundle of axons that connects hemispheres
Frontal lobe|Personality, "higher mental functions"
Parietal lobe|Behind central sulcus
Occipital lobe|Back end of brain, visual processing
Temporal lobe|Ventral to other lobes, around your temples. Hearing and speech
Basal ganglia|Ganglia, interior of cortical folds (not part of cortex), important in postural adjustments and planning movements. Putamen, globus pallidus, caudate
Lymic system|Amygdala, Hippocampus, Nucleus accumbens
Amygdala|area of emotion, rage, repulsion, fear
Hippocampus|Memory is formed
Nucleus accumbens|reward/pleasure circuit. Plays role in addiction, other non destructive behavior.
Olfactory bulb|Chemical sensors in nose project to bulb, underside of brain. Neurons project to olfactory cortex.
Diencephalon|Thalamus, Lateral gerniculate, Medial geniculate, hypothalamus
Thalamus|Sensory processes and distributes most sensory and motor information to and from the Telencephalon
Lateral gerniculate|Visual processing, receives information from the retina, conveyed by the optic nerve.
Medial geniculate|Processes auditory information
Hypothalamus|below the Thalamus, important for homeostasis. Regulates hormone secretion using pituitary(body temp, blood pressure, salt balance), regulates behavior for eating drinking, thirst, salt consumption, shivering
