Voltage clamp|allows you to measure how permeable a membrane is and how ions are moving across it in real time. 2 electrodes needed inside cell. One to measure Vm, one to pass current.
Command voltage|you tell the circuitry what you want Vm to be
Voltage clamp circuitry|look at Vm is, where you set it (command voltage), then pass current into cell to make them match using the second electrode
Set Vm to -40 in squid (below threshold at -20)|Small inward current, no outward current
Set Vm at threshold|Initial normal inward and outward current.
Set Vm to +26mV|compared to setting at threshold, smaller inward current and larger outward current
Set Vm to +55mV or Driving force of Na+(ENa+)|No inward current, just outward
Set Vm to +65, 10 mB more positive that Ena+|Two outward currents, no inward
Conductance|the inverse of resistance:  G = (1/R)
Conductance(G) of Na+|high at beginning of AP, lower later during AP - V-gated channels and soon close
K+ conductance(G)|high and peaks later than Na+ in AP - V-gated channels open with a slight delay and stay open for a while
TTX (Tetradotoxin)|blocks Na+ channels. No inward Na+ flow, outward only. WE can now see how changing [K+] in and out can affect driving force.
TEA (Tetraethyl Ammonium)|blocks v-gated K+ channels, only inward current.  
B toxin from scorpians|causes Na+ channels to open at more (-) Vm than normal.Open sooner for lower Vm. V-clamp graph looks similar but the entire thing is shifted down toward inflow.
B toxin and TEA|stronger inflow, no outflow
B toxin and TTX|No inflow, normal outflow.
Driving force|tells you the strength of the forces acting on each ion, it is the difference between the membrane potential and the ion's equilibrium potential. df = V_m - E_ion (membrane potential - equilibrium potential)
Dendrotoxin|Causes massive firing of pain fibers, Vm is more depolarized than normal. Only influx, no outflux. Blocks K+ channels only, no affect on Na+ channels.
Dendrotoxin with TTX|no net current in or out.
Dendrotoxin with TEA|Normal in current only.
Patch clamp can be used as a voltage clamp|Smooth pipette electrode is brought to cell membrane and sealed, allows you to record activity of all the channels inside the edges of the pipette.
Block channels with TTX, patch clamp reading|Patch clamp with voltage clamp conditions well above threshold
4 types of v-gated channels have been identified|Na+, K+, Ca++, Cl-
K+channels are most|varied in properties
Molecular features of ion channels|membrane spanning regions, central pore, loop of amino acids, gate that can be opened or closed
We can restrict Na+ from a K+ channels using|small size, even though Na+ is technically smaller than K+. Water molecule binding(Na+ carries 3+ water molecules, K+ carries 2)
We can restrict K+ from a Na+ channels using|Magic. Still unknown
Na+ channels|single protein, 6 membrane spanning regions, each with 4 domains. Voltage sensor may be the S4 helix found in each domain. It is covered in pos charged lysine. Has Activation and Inactivation gate.
Activation gate|opens as soon as Vm becomes more (+), Na+ passes through the channel. Activation gate eventually shuts off with Vm becoming more negative.
Inactivation gate|activation gate's opening triggers it to close, shutting off Na+ movement even though the activation gate may still be open.
Ca++ channels|membrane spanning regions, each with 4 domains, single protein. everal different Ca++ channel genes so several different varieties (like Na+)
Cl- channels|also from one protein
K+ Channels|assembled from 4 seperately transcribed subunits. Can be combined to various ways to impart various features on the K+ channel's function much more variability in K+ Channels
K+ Channel in squid axon|Opens when Vm is becoming +, closes when vm is -
delayed rectifier channel|K+ channel stays open as long as Vm is positive
The A Channel|k+ Channel that closes shortly after it opens, Ball and chain idea. Enterance is blocked by ball quickly after it opens
M Channels|Muscarine activates them, acts similar to delayed rectifier (not Vm)
S Channels|Seratonin activates them, acts similar to delayed rectifier (not Vm)
Ca++ activated K Channel|Opens in response to Ca++ inside cell reaches certain level
Bursty Cell|Membrane depolarizes, crosses threshold, AP fires until Vm drops below threshold again. Usually used for rhythmic activity.   1. Leakage Ca++ channels - responsible for depolarizatio; 2. V-gated Na+ Channels; 3. V-gated K+ Channels; 4. Ca++ activated k+ channels; 5. Ca++ pumps remove excess [Ca++]in
Channelopathies|genetic mutations of ion channels
Ca++ Channels are sometimes mutated|can be truncated and lead to abnormal limb movement, nausea, headache, vertigo, brought by stress and stops after a few hours
Na+ channel mutation|can lead to seizures, one tpye is only in children, stops in puberty
Myotonia congenita|mutation of Cl- channel, Cl- channels keep Vm below threshold. When animal wants to carry out muscle action, muscle depolarizes and contracts, without proper Cl- function it keeps depolarizing and, "seizes up" and animal freezes
internal resistance of the cytoplasm|is _Ri_
length constant (lambda)|the distance a given charge in Vm can travel before declining to a certain level, lambda = sqrt(Rm/Ri)
Rm|how easily charges cross membrane
Ri|determines how easily charges move inside
Time constant (Tau)|a different set of factors determine how quickly the charges can change Vm (To reach threshold if you want to  generate an AP). Depends on membrane capacitance **Cm**
Tau|Tau = Cm*Rm, tells  you how long it takes for Vm to reach 1 - 1/e of the  final Vm
To optimize speed of AP|you would want a long lambda and a short _time constant_, but Tau = Cm*Rm and lambda = Rm/Ri
What is the role of myelin|small Cm of myelin lowers the Tau (time needed for charges to move) and raises the lambda (distance traveled) as charges don't leak back out
Electrical Synaptic Transmission|ionic charge moves directly between neurons through channels (Connexons)
Connexons|located on membranes of the pre and postsynaptic neurons, which meet at a gap junction. Pre synaptic cell line up with post synaptic cell connexons to make a channel. Made up of 6 subunits with a channel down the middle. This is often not a very specific channel, ions flow either direction.
Chemical|synapses offer flexibility, synaptic cleft is a physical space between neurons, uses neurotransmitters
Synapse needs extracellular|Ca++ to pass a chemical signal. Substituting Mg++ for Ca++ in saline will block synaptic transmission
PSP|transient change in membrane potential,can spread a lot depending on space and tome constants is this is large enough to generate AP
epsp|excitatory postsynaptic potential
ipsp|inhibatory postsynaptic potential
Ach opens a channel that allows passage of|both Na+ and K, but k flows out
Reversal potential|is Vm where the Na+ entering is balanced by K+ exiting and there is not net current. Will see no change in Vm when apply ACh. Vrev = Ena + Ek /2, or Vrev = n(Ena+) + (Ek+)/ n+1 [how many more times Na+ is permiable over K+, if K+ is more either use a frac or move n in front of ek+]
Molecular structure of ACh gated receptor|can be isolated in neuromuscular junction. 5 Subunits: 2 a, 1 b, 1 d, 1g.
Nicotinic ACh receptor|Binding sites on a subunit, needs 2 ACh molecules, one at each subunit. Provides EPSP.
Metabolic ACh gated channels|like the muscarinic receptor
alpha bungarotoxin|Toxins target nicotinc ACh receptor, binds irreversibly
EPSP|Above threshold
IPSP|Below threshold, Cl- and K+ moving through a channel could create a IPSP.
When will a IPSPS occur?|Happens when Vrev is below threshold, as Vm will move torward Vrev when channel opens.
GABA|inhibitory neurotransmitter
GABA channel structure|gated channel has 5 subununits, GABA binds to b subununit. Opens channel for Cl-
Drugs on GABA|Some drugs bind to secondary sites that enhance opening. Barbituates and tranquilizers.
Neuromodulation|Molecules that act on nerves to enhance or inhibit nerves
