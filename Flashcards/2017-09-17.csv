Microgilia|immune response. made in bone marrow, highly mobile. clean up cellular debris, see a lot near infections or neurodegenerative diseases (Parkison's, Huntington's, Alzheimer's). Excessive activity during development may remove too many synapses leading to issues like possibly autism??
Oligodenetroglia|found in CNS (brain, spinal cord) only, generate _myelin_ (flattened cell membrane w/o plasma) from glial cell. Electrical insulator, allows action potentials to move quicker and more reliably. Each _oligodentrocyte_ myelinates several axons. Block axon regrowth on damage.

Amygdala|area of emotion, rage, repulsion, fear
Hippocampus|Memory is formed
Nucleus accumbens|reward/pleasure circuit. Plays role in addiction, other non destructive behavior.

Lateral gerniculate|Visual processing, receives information from the retina, conveyed by the optic nerve.

Cerebellum|Maintain muscle tone and balance. Helps in planning out movement smoothly. Motor memory. Receives information from cerebral cortex indirectly about planned movements. Receives info from cerebral cortex about sensory feedback from movement as well. Cerebellum compares these pieces of information to make sure movement happened correctly, generated correction
Motor error|signals indicate incorrect motion compared to intended motion in cerebellum, correction is then made
Pontire nucleous|receive info about _intended_ movement. Extend out into mossy fibers which synapse with granule cells. Granule cells send up its own axon that synapse the _Purkinje cells_ using parallel fibers.
Inferior olive of Myelencephalon|Gets input about _actual_ movements, synapse with _Purkinje cells_ using climbing fibers, wrap dendrites.

Cerebrospinal fluid|Produced from blood in _chorid plexus_ in addition to ionic balance, its important as a shock absorber
Meninges|Surrounding the CNS, set of 3 membranes
Blood brain barrier|also regulates what ions/proteins reach brain. Capillary endothelial cells in CNS are joined by the tight junctions. Stuff cannot exit or enter these capillaries unless they pass through endothelial cells membrane using small lipid soluable molecules or transporters.
Astrocytes|Secrete molecules/proteins to stimulate endothelial cells of capillaries to regulate tightness of tight junction, regulate permeability of blood brain barrier.
Sympathetic|Fight or flight responses. ACh and norepinephrine as NT
norepinephrine|fight or flight, causes effects like inc hr, inc blood flow to muscles, sweat, inhibit digestion, mobilizes glucose, activates adrenal glands, dialates pupils.

Voltage clamp|allows you to measure how permeable a membrane is and how ions are moving across it in real time. 2 electrodes needed inside cell. One to measure Vm, one to pass current.
Command voltage|you tell the circuitry what you want Vm to be
voltage clamp circuitry|look at Vm is, where you set it (command voltage), then pass current into cell to make them match using the second electrode
