Patellar Stretch Reflex|Maintains specific tension and length of quadriceps muscle
Ganglion|structure containing a number of nerve cell bodies, physical expansion of spinal chord, connects processes out to muscles.
Dorsal root ganglion|contains the cell bodies of sensory neurons that bring information from the periphery to the spinal cord. Used in stretch reflex
Ganglion/nucleous|A collection of nerve cell bodies
Process|(neurite) extends from ganglion to muscle (term used instead of axon/dendrite)
Sensory Neuron|Detects signals from environment, sends a process to the CNS into the inner gray matter
Pre-Synaptic|Sensory neuron endings, releases neurotransmitters
Post-Synaptic|Motor neuron, receives neurotransmitters
Motor neuron|exists in gray matter of spinal chord, sends signals to muscle via process from CNS
Synaptic cleft|gap, interacts with receptors on post-synaptic cell
Nerre|Collection of processes, bundle of sensory and motor fibers
Afferent|incoming signal to CNS - *dorsal root*
Efferent|outgoing signal from CNS - *ventral root*
Sensory neuron|synapses with motor neuron are on the motor neuron's *dendrites*
Motor neuron|extends an *axon* out to the muscle
Shapes of neurons|reflect who they're connected to (long processes for motor neurons can be 3ft long), where they receive inputs and where they send them
Anaxonal neuron|Difficult to distinguish between inputs and outputs, no obvious axon
Monopolar|(unipolar) only one process extends from body
Bipolar|Branch goes up one way and down another
Multipolar neuron|classic neuron, cell body with dendrites on body and single axon
Interneurons|process signals between sensory and motor neurons
