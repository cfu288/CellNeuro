* **Brain and the Lateral Geniculate**
  * projections from retina cross the midline at the optic chiasm
    * (most of) right eye axons to left side of brain in primates, all axons in others
      * important in depth perception
    * axons that receive inputs from the left half of the visual field from each eye will join up together in the right lateral geniculate.
    (IMG)
    * Images from the right half of the vision field will fall on the Lateral side of the left retina and nasal side of right retina and the inputs from the left eye do not cross at the chiasm axons from the right eye do creoss at the chiasm and both meet up in the left lateral geniculate (LGN)
  * Organization of the LGN   
    * retina is mapped out in  a topographic map of the world
    * 6 layers in the LGN, each layer has the topographic map, each map are stacked in perfect register.
      * in other words, if experimentally you stick an electrode through theLGN, go straight through all 6 layers, all the cells you records will respond to the stimuli in the same place of the receptive field. Extra representation of the fovea.
    * Layers 1/2 contain large **magnocellular cells** - They receive synapses from M ganglion cells.
    * Layers 3-6 have smaller cells called **parvocellular cells** - receive input from P cells of retina
      * **layers 1,4,6** - from the contralateral eye
      * **Layers 2,3,5** - from ipsilateral eye
    * M layer cells of layer 1/2 are not color sensitive, are sensitive to contrasts and motion
    * P cells of layers 3-6 are color sensitive, high resolution.  Layers may see same part of the world but sensitive to different colors, 3 and 5 will have differnt color sensitivities for example.
    * Each cell in LGN has a particular piece of information that it can pass on to the next level of processing.
    * But: only 25% of input to LGN is from retina, 75%comes from visual cortex and brainstem. What is it doing?
