# README

This is a repository to store and manage notes for my Cellular Neurobiology class.

Notes are written in markdown for easy formatting and printing.

ProcessNotes.sh skims my notes and uses RE to detect and auto-generate a csv file of vocabulary terms that should be memorized. Lines in the format:

 * **Term** - Definition of terms

 will be added to the csv.

 The csv then can be imported into a flashcard app like **_Anki_** for easy memorization.

 Generated csv files are stored in the Flashcards folder, images that are referenced in the notes are stored in the Images folder
