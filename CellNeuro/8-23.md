== 8-23 Notes ==
* Textbook not req but reccommended.
* Make 2 copies of hw, one to keep one to hand in
* May move to UU 109 - Keep an eye out
* Neurobiology - study of neurons
    * Simple neural circut - Knee jerk reflex
        (IMG FROM SLIDES)
        * *Patellar Strech Reflex* - Maintains specific tension and length of quadriceps muscle
            * Tapping below the knee stretches the muscle, contracts to regain original length, foot swings
            * In muscle, stretch is detected by sensory neuron
                * Neuron exists in ganglion, extends a process out to the muscle to sense
            * Ganglion - physical expansion of spinal chord, connects processes out to muscles. 
            * *Dorsal root ganglion* - specific ganglion used in stretch reflex(?)
            * *Ganglion =?= nucleous* - A collection of nerve cell bodies
            * *Process* - (neurite) extends from ganglion to muscule (term used instead of axon/dendrite)
            * CNS - Spinal chord
                * White matter and grey matter (cross section image)
            * *Sensory Neuron* sends a process to the CNS into the inner grey matter
                * Then interacts with a second neuron at synapse, *motor neuron*
            * *Pre-Synaptic* - Sensory neuron endings, releases neurotransmitters
            * *Post-Synaptic* - Motor neuron
            * *Motor neuron* - exists in gret matter of spinal chord
            * *Synaptic cleft* - gap, interacts with receptors on post-synaptic cell
            * Motor neuron's response travels out of the CNS to muscle via a process, here it becomes a presynaptic contact with the now postsynampic muscle.
            * Signal leas to contraction
            * Motor neuron then extends a process back to the muscle
            * *Nerre* - Collection of processes, bundle of sensory and moter fibers
            * *Afferent* - incoming signal to CNS - *dorsal root*
            * *Efferent* - outgoing signal from CNS - *ventral root*
            * *Sensory neuron* - synapses with motor neuron are on the motor neuron's *dendrites*
            * *Motor neuron* - extends an *axon* out to the muscle
            * Neuron has *resting potential* - electricl differenc ebetween interior and outside. When electrical potential changes,this signal can be sent through the neuron and to the next neuron in line
